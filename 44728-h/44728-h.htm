<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>These lectures were delivered at the London
School of Economics in May of the present year.
They are largely based on experience gained in the
work of the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to
Melanesia of 1908, and give a simplified record of
social conditions which will be described in detail
in the full account of the work of that expedition.</p>

<p>A few small additions and modifications have
been made since the lectures were given, some of
these being due to suggestions made by Professor
Westermarck and Dr. Malinowski in the discussions
which followed the lectures. I am also
indebted to Miss B. Freire-Marreco for allowing
me to refer to unpublished material collected
during her recent work among the Pueblo Indians
of North America.</p>

<h2>LECTURE I</h2>


<p>The aim of these lectures is to demonstrate the
close connection which exists between methods of
denoting relationship or kinship and forms of social
organisation, including those based on different
varieties of the institution of marriage. In other
words, my aim will be to show that the terminology
of relationship has been rigorously determined by
social conditions and that, if this position has been
established and accepted, systems of relationship
furnish us with a most valuable instrument in
studying the history of social institutions.</p>

<p>In the controversy of the present and of recent
times, it is the special mode of denoting relationship
known as the classificatory system which has
formed the chief subject of discussion. It is in
connection with this system that there have arisen
the various vexed questions which have so excited
the interest&mdash;I might almost say the passions&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sociologists during the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p>I am afraid it would be dangerous to assume
your familiarity with this system, and I must
therefore begin with a brief description of its main
characters. The essential feature of the classificatory
system, that to which it owes its name, is
the application of its terms, not to single individual
persons, but to classes of relatives which may often
be very large. Objections have been made to the
use of the term “classificatory” on the ground
that our own terms of relationship also apply to
classes of persons; the term “brother,” for instance,
to all the male children of the same father and
mother, the term “uncle” to all the brothers of the
father and mother as well as to the husband of an
aunt, while the term “cousin” may denote a still
larger class. It is, of course, true that many of
our own terms of relationship apply to classes of
persons, but in the systems to which the word
“classificatory” is usually applied, the classificatory
principle applies far more widely, and in some cases
even, more logically and consistently. In the most
complete form of the classificatory system there is
not one single term of relationship the use of which
tells us that reference is being made to one person
and to one person only, whereas in our own system
there are six such terms, viz., husband, wife,
father, mother, father-in-law and mother-in-law.
In those systems in which the classificatory
principle is carried to its extreme degree every
term is applied to a class of persons. The term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
“father,” for instance, is applied to all those whom
the father would call brother, and to all the
husbands of those whom the mother calls sister,
both brother and sister being used in a far wider
sense than among ourselves. In some forms of the
classificatory system the term “father” is also used
for all those whom the mother would call brother,
and for all the husbands of those whom the father
would call sister, and in other systems the application
of the term may be still more extensive.
Similarly, the term used for the wife may be
applied to all those whom the wife would call sister
and to the wives of all those whom the speaker calls
brother, brother and sister again being used in a
far wider sense than in our own language.</p>

<p>The classificatory system has many other features
which mark it off more or less sharply from our
own mode of denoting relationship, but I do not
think it would be profitable to attempt a full
description at this stage of our enquiry. As I have
said, the object of these lectures is to show how
the various features of the classificatory system
have arisen out of, and can therefore be explained
historically by, social facts. If you are not
already acquainted with these features, you will
learn to know them the more easily if at the same
time you learn how they have come into existence.</p>

<p>I will begin with a brief history of the subject.
So long as it was supposed that all the peoples of
the world denoted relationship in the same way,
namely, that which is customary among ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
there was no problem. There was no reason why
the subject should have awakened any interest, and
so far as I have been able to find, it is only since
the discovery of the classificatory system of
relationship that the problem now before us was
ever raised. I imagine that, if students ever thought
about the matter at all, it must have seemed
obvious that the way in which they and the other
known peoples of the world used terms of relationship
was conditioned and determined by the social
relations which the terms denoted.</p>

<p>The state of affairs became very different as soon
as it was known that many peoples of the world
use terms of relationship in a manner, and according
to rules, so widely different from our own that
they seem to belong to an altogether different
order, a difference well illustrated by the confusion
which is apt to arise when we use English words
in the translation of classificatory terms or classificatory
terms as the equivalents of our own. The
difficulty or impossibility of conforming to complete
truth and reality, when we attempt this task, is
the best witness to the fundamental difference
between the two modes of denoting relationship.</p>

<p>I do not know of any discovery in the whole
range of science which can be more certainly put
to the credit of one man than that of the classificatory
system of relationship by Lewis Morgan.
By this I mean, not merely that he was the first
to point out clearly the existence of this mode of
denoting relationship, but that it was he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
collected the vast mass of material by which the
essential characters of the system were demonstrated,
and it was he who was the first to recognise
the great theoretical importance of his new discovery.
It is the denial of this importance by
his contemporaries and successors which furnishes
the best proof of the credit which is due to him
for the discovery. The very extent of the material
he collected<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has probably done much to obstruct
the recognition of the importance of his work.
It is a somewhat discouraging thought that, if
Morgan had been less industrious and had amassed
a smaller collection of material which could have
been embodied in a more available form, the value
of his work would probably have been far more
widely recognised than it is to-day. The volume
of his material is, however, only a subsidiary factor
in the process which has led to the neglect or
rejection of the importance of Morgan’s discovery.
The chief cause of the neglect is one for which
Morgan must himself largely bear the blame. He
was not content to demonstrate, as he might to
some extent have done from his own material, the
close connection between the terminology of the
classificatory system of relationship and forms of
social organisation. There can be little doubt that
he recognised this connection, but he was not content
to demonstrate the dependence of the
terminology of relationship upon social forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
existence of which was already known, or which
were capable of demonstration with the material
at his disposal. He passed over all these early
stages of the argument, and proceeded directly
to refer the origin of the terminology to forms of
social organisation which were not known to exist
anywhere on the earth and of which there was no
direct evidence in the past. When, further, the
social condition which Morgan was led to formulate
was one of general promiscuity developing into
group-marriage, conditions bitterly repugnant to
the sentiments of most civilised persons, it is not
surprising that he aroused a mass of heated
opposition which led, not merely to widespread
rejection of his views, but also to the neglect of
lessons to be learnt from his new discovery which
must have received general recognition long before
this, if they had not been obscured by other issues.</p>

<p>The first to take up the cudgels in opposition to
Morgan was our own pioneer in the study of the
early forms of human society, John Ferguson
McLennan.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He criticised the views of Morgan
severely and often justly, and then pointing out,
as was then believed to be the case, that no duties
or rights were connected with the relationships
of the classificatory system, he concluded that the
terms formed merely a code of courtesies and
ceremonial addresses for social intercourse. Those
who have followed him have usually been content
to repeat the conclusion that the classificatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
system is nothing more than a body of mutual
salutations and terms of address. They have failed
to see that it still remains necessary to explain how
the terms of the classificatory system came to be
used in mutual salutation. They have failed to
recognise that they were either rejecting the
principle of determinism in sociology, or were
only putting back to a conveniently remote distance
the consideration of the problem how and
why the classificatory terms came to be used in
the way now customary among so many peoples
of the earth.</p>

<p>This aspect of the problem, which has been
neglected or put on one side by the followers of
McLennan, was not so treated by McLennan
himself. As we should expect from the general
character of his work, McLennan clearly recognised
that the classificatory system must have been
determined by social conditions, and he tried to
show how it might have arisen as the result of the
change from the Nair to the Tibetan form of
polyandry.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He even went so far as to formulate
varieties of this process by means of which there
might have been produced the chief varieties of the
classificatory system, the existence of which had
been demonstrated by Morgan. It is quite clear
that McLennan had no doubts about the necessity
of tracing back the social institution of the classificatory
system of relationship to social causes, a
necessity which has been ignored or even explicitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
denied by those who have followed him in rejecting
the views of Morgan. It is one of the many
unfortunate consequences of McLennan’s belief in
the importance of polyandry in the history of
human society that it has helped to prevent his
followers from seeing the social importance of the
classificatory system. They have failed to see that
the classificatory system may be the result neither
of promiscuity nor of polyandry, and yet have been
determined, both in its general character and in its
details, by forms of social organisation.</p>

<p>Since the time of Morgan and McLennan few
have attempted to deal with the question in any
comprehensive manner. The problem has inevitably
been involved in the controversy which has
raged between the advocates of the original promiscuity
or the primitive monogamy of mankind, but
most of the former have been ready to accept
Morgan’s views blindly, while the latter have been
content to try to explain away the importance of
conclusions derived from the classificatory system
without attempting any real study of the evidence.
On the side of Morgan there has been one exception
in the person of Professor J. Kohler,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who has
recognised the lines on which the problem must be
studied, while on the other side there has been, so
far as I am aware, only one writer who has recognised
that the evidence from the nature of the
classificatory system of relationship cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ignored or belittled, but must be faced and some
explanation alternative to that of Morgan provided.</p>

<p>This attempt was made four years ago by Professor
Kroeber,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the University of California.
The line he takes is absolutely to reject the view
common to both Morgan and McLennan that the
nature of the classificatory system has been determined
by social conditions. He explicitly rejects
the view that the mode of using terms of relationship
depends on social causes, and puts forward as
the alternative that they are conditioned by causes
purely linguistic and psychological.</p>

<p>It is not quite easy to understand what is meant
by the linguistic causation of terms of relationship.
In the summary at the end of his paper Kroeber
concludes that “they (terms of relationship) are
determined primarily by language.” Terms of
relationship, however, are elements of language,
so that Kroeber’s proposition is that elements of
language are determined primarily by language. In
so far as this proposition has any meaning, it must
be that, in the process of seeking the origin of
linguistic phenomena, it is our business to ignore
any but linguistic facts. It would follow that the
student of the subject should seek the antecedents
of linguistic phenomena in other linguistic
phenomena, and put on one side as not germane to
his task all reference to the objects and relations
which the words denote and connote.</p>

<p>Professor Kroeber’s alternative proposition is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that terms of relationship reflect psychology, not
sociology, or, in other words, that the way in which
terms of relationship are used depends on a chain
of causation in which psychological processes are
the direct antecedents of this use. I will try to
make his meaning clear by means of an instance
which he himself gives. He says that at the
present time there is a tendency among ourselves
to speak of the brother-in-law as a brother; in other
words, we tend to class the brother-in-law and the
brother together in the nomenclature of our own
system of relationship. He supposes that we do
this because there is a psychological similarity
between the two relationships which leads us to
class them together in our customary nomenclature.
I shall return both to this and other of his examples
later.</p>

<p>We have now seen that the opponents of Morgan
have taken up two main positions which it is
possible to attack: one, that the classificatory
system is nothing more than a body of terms of
address; the other, that it and other modes of
denoting relationship are determined by psychological
and not by sociological causes. I propose to
consider these two positions in turn.</p>

<p>Morgan himself was evidently deeply impressed
by the function of the classificatory system of
relationship as a body of salutations. His own
experience was derived from the North American
Indians, and he notes the exclusive use of terms
of relationship in address, a usage so habitual that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
an omission to recognise a relative in this manner
would amount almost to an affront. Morgan also
points out, as one motive for the custom, the
presence of a reluctance to utter personal names.
McLennan had to rely entirely on the evidence
collected by Morgan, and there can be no doubt
that he was greatly influenced by the stress Morgan
himself laid on the function of the classificatory
terms as mutual salutations. That in rude societies
certain relatives have social functions definitely
assigned to them by custom was known in Morgan’s
time, and I think it might even then have been
discovered that the relationships which carried
these functions were of the classificatory kind. It
is, however, only by more recent work, beginning
with that of Howitt, of Spencer and Gillen, and
of Roth in Australia, and of the Cambridge
Expedition to Torres Straits, that the great importance
of the functions of relatives through the
classificatory system has been forced upon the
attention of sociologists. The social and ceremonial
proceedings of the Australian aborigines abound in
features in which special functions are performed
by such relatives as the elder brother or the brother
of the mother, while in Torres Straits I was able
to record large groups of duties, privileges and
restrictions associated with different classificatory
relationships.</p>

<p>Further work has shown that widely, though not
universally, the nomenclature of the classificatory
system carries with it a number of clearly defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
social practices. One who applies a given term of
relationship to another person has to behave
towards that person in certain definite ways. He
has to perform certain duties towards him, and
enjoys certain privileges, and is subject to certain
restrictions in his conduct in relation to him. These
duties, privileges and restrictions vary greatly in
number among different peoples, but wherever
they exist, I know of no exception to their importance
and to the regard in which they are held by
all members of the community. You doubtless
know of many examples of such functions associated
with relationship, and I need give only one
example.</p>

<p>In the Banks Islands the term used between two
brothers-in-law is <i>wulus</i>, <i>walus</i>, or <i>walui</i>, and a
man who applies one of these terms to another may
not utter his name, nor may the two behave
familiarly towards one another in any way. In one
island, Merlav, these relatives have all their possessions
in common, and it is the duty of one to help
the other in any difficulty, to warn him in danger,
and, if need be, to die with him. If one dies, the
other has to help to support his widow and has to
abstain from certain foods. Further, there are a
number of curious regulations in which the sanctity
of the head plays a great part. A man must take
nothing from above the head of his brother-in-law,
nor may he even eat a bird which has flown over
his head. A person has only to say of an object
“That is the head of your brother-in-law,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the person addressed will have to desist from the
use of the object. If the object is edible, it may
not be eaten; if it is one which is being manufactured,
such as a mat, the person addressed will
have to cease from his work if the object be thus
called the head of his brother-in-law. He will only
be allowed to finish it on making compensation,
not to the person who has prevented the work by
reference to the head, but to the brother-in-law
whose head had been mentioned. Ludicrous
as some of these customs may seem to us, they
are very far from being so to those who practise
them. They show clearly the very important
part taken in the lives of those who use the classificatory
system by the social functions associated
with relationship. As I have said, these functions
are not universally associated with the classificatory
system, but they are very general in many parts
of the world and only need more careful investigation
to be found even more general and more
important than appears at present.</p>

<p>Let us now look at our own system of relationship
from this point of view. Two striking features
present themselves. First, the great paucity of
definite social functions associated with relationship,
and secondly, the almost complete limitation
of such functions to those relationships which
apply only to individual persons and not to classes
of persons. Of such relationships as cousin, uncle,
aunt, father-in-law, or mother-in-law there may be
said to be no definite social functions. A school-boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
believes it is the duty of his uncle to tip him,
but this is about as near as one can get to any
social obligation on the part of this relative.</p>

<p>The same will be found to hold good to a large
extent if we turn to those social regulations which
have been embodied in our laws. It is only in the
case of the transmission of hereditary rank and of
the property of a person dying intestate that more
distant relatives are brought into any legal relationship
with one another, and then only if there is an
absence of nearer relatives. It is only when forced
to do so by exceptional circumstances that the law
recognises any of the persons to whom the more
classificatory of our terms of relationship apply.
If we pay regard to the social functions associated
with relationship, it is our own system, rather than
the classificatory, which is open to the reproach
that its relationships carry into them no rights and
duties.</p>

<p>In the course of the recent work of the Percy
Sladen Trust Expedition in Melanesia and Polynesia
I have been able to collect a body of facts
which bring out, even more clearly than has hitherto
been recognised, the dependence of classificatory
terms on social rights.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The classificatory systems
of Oceania vary greatly in character. In some
places relationships are definitely distinguished in
nomenclature which are classed with other relationships
elsewhere. Thus, while most Melanesian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
some Polynesian systems have a definite term for
the mother’s brother and for the class of relatives
whom the mother calls brother, in other systems
this relative is classed with, and is denoted by, the
same term as the father. The point to which I
now call your attention is that there is a very close
correlation between the presence of a special term
for this relative and the presence of special
functions attached to the relationship.</p>

<p>In Polynesia, both the Hawaiians and the
inhabitants of Niue class the mother’s brother with
the father, and in neither place was I able to
discover that there were any special duties,
privileges or restrictions ascribed to the mother’s
brother. In the Polynesian islands of Tonga
and Tikopia, on the other hand, where there are
special terms for the mother’s brother, this relative
has also special functions. The only place in
Melanesia where I failed to find a special term for
the mother’s brother was in the western Solomon
Islands, and that was also the only part of
Melanesia where I failed to find any trace of special
social functions ascribed to this relative. I do not
know of such functions in Santa Cruz, but my
information about the system of that island is
derived from others, and further research will
almost certainly show that they are present.</p>

<p>In my own experience, then, among two different
peoples, I have been able to establish a definite
correlation between the presence of a term of
relationship and special functions associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the relationship. Information kindly given to me
by Father Egidi, however, seems to show that the
correlation among the Melanesians is not complete.
In Mekeo, the mother’s brother has the duty of
putting on the first perineal garment of his nephew,
but he has no special term and is classed with the
father. Among the Kuni, on the other hand, there
is a definite term for the mother’s brother distinguishing
him from the father, but yet he has
not, so far as Father Egidi knows, any special
functions.</p>

<p>Both in Melanesia and Polynesia a similar correlation
comes out in connection with other relationships,
the most prominent exception being the
absence of a special term for the father’s sister in
the Banks Islands, although this relative has very
definite and important functions. In these islands
the father’s sister is classed with the mother as
<i>vev</i> or <i>veve</i>, but even here, where the generalisation
seems to break down, it does not do so completely,
for the father’s sister is distinguished from the
mother as <i>veve vus rawe</i>, the mother who kills a
pig, as opposed to the simple <i>veve</i> used for the
mother and her sisters.</p>

<p>There is thus definite evidence, not only for the
association of classificatory terms of relationship
with special social functions, but from one part of
the world we now have evidence which shows that
the presence or absence of special terms is largely
dependent on whether there are or are not such
functions. We may take it as established that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
terms of the classificatory system are not, as
McLennan supposed, merely terms of address and
modes of mutual salutation. McLennan came to
this conclusion because he believed that the classificatory
terms were associated with no such
functions as those of which we now have abundant
evidence. He asks, “What duties or rights are
affected by the relationships comprised in the classificatory
system?” and answers himself according
to the knowledge at his disposal, “Absolutely
none.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This passage makes it clear that, if
McLennan had known what we know to-day, he
would never have taken up the line of attack upon
Morgan’s position in which he has had, and still
has, so many followers.</p>



<p class="tb">I can now turn to the second line of attack, that
which boldly discards the origin of the terminology
of relationship in social conditions, and seeks for its
explanation in psychology. The line of argument
I propose to follow is first to show that many
details of classificatory systems have been directly
determined by social factors. If that task can
be accomplished, we shall have firm ground from
which to take off in the attempt to refer the general
characters of the classificatory and other systems of
relationship to forms of social organisation. Any
complete theory of a social institution has not only
to account for its general characters, but also for
its details, and I propose to begin with the details.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>I must first return to the history of the subject,
and stay for a moment to ask why the line of
argument I propose to follow was not adopted by
Morgan and has been so largely disregarded by
others.</p>

<p>Whenever a new phenomenon is discovered in
any part of the world, there is a natural tendency
to seek for its parallels elsewhere. Morgan lived
at a time when the unity of human culture was a
topic which greatly excited ethnologists, and it is
evident that one of his chief interests in the new
discovery arose from the possibility it seemed to
open of showing the uniformity of human culture.
He hoped to demonstrate the uniformity of the
classificatory system throughout the world, and he
was content to observe certain broad varieties of
the system and refer them to supposed stages in
the history of human society. He paid but little
attention to such varieties of the classificatory
system as are illustrated in his own record of North
American systems, and seems to have overlooked
entirely certain features of the Indian and Oceanic
systems he recorded, which might have enabled
him to demonstrate the close relation between the
terminology of relationship and social institutions.
Morgan’s neglect to attend to these differences
must be ascribed in some measure to the ignorance
of rude forms of social organisation which existed
when he wrote, but the failure of others to recognise
the dependence of the details of classificatory
systems upon social institutions is rather to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ascribed to the absence of interest in the subject
induced by their adherence to McLennan’s primary
error. Those who believe that the classificatory
system is merely an unimportant code of mutual
salutations are not likely to attend to relatively
minute differences in the customs they despise.
The credit of having been the first fully to recognise
the social importance of these differences
belongs to J. Kohler. In his book “Zur Urgeschichte
der Ehe,” which I have already mentioned,
he studied minutely the details of many different
systems, and showed that they could be explained
by certain forms of marriage practised by those
who use the terms. I propose now to deal with
classificatory terminology from this point of
view. My procedure will be first to show that
the details which distinguish different forms of the
classificatory system from one another have been
directly determined by the social institutions of
those who use the systems, and only when this has
been established, shall I attempt to bring the more
general characters of the classificatory and other
systems into relation with social institutions.</p>

<p>I am able to carry out this task more fully than
has hitherto been possible because I have collected
in Melanesia a number of systems of relationship
which differ far more widely from one another than
those recorded in Morgan’s book or others which
have been collected since. Some of the features
which characterise these Melanesian systems will
be wholly new to ethnologists, not having yet been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
recorded elsewhere, but I propose to begin with
a long familiar mode of terminology which accompanies
that widely distributed custom known as
the cross-cousin marriage. In the more frequent
form of this marriage a man marries the daughter
either of his mother’s brother or of his father’s
sister; more rarely his choice is limited to one of
these relatives.</p>

<p>Such a marriage will have certain definite
consequences. Let us take a case in which a man
marries the daughter of his mother’s brother, as is
represented in the following diagram:</p>

<div>
<p class="center smcap">Diagram 1<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/zill_t020.png" width="500" height="111" alt="" />
</div></div>

<p>One consequence of the marriage between <i>C</i> and <i>d</i>
will be that <i>A</i>, who before the marriage of <i>C</i> was
only his mother’s brother, now becomes also his
wife’s father, while <i>b</i>, who before the marriage
was the mother’s brother’s wife of <i>C</i>, now becomes
his wife’s mother. Reciprocally, <i>C</i>, who before
his marriage had been the sister’s son of <i>A</i> and the
husband’s sister’s son of <i>b</i>, now becomes their
son-in-law. Further, <i>E</i> and <i>f</i>, the other children
of <i>A</i> and <i>b</i>, who before the marriage had been only
the cousins of <i>C</i>, now become his wife’s brother
and sister.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>Similarly, <i>a</i>, who before the marriage of <i>d</i> was
her father’s sister, now becomes also her husband’s
mother, and <i>B</i>, her father’s sister’s husband, comes
to stand in the relation of husband’s father;
if <i>C</i> should have any brothers and sisters, these
cousins now become her brothers- and sisters-in-law.</p>

<p>The combinations of relationship which follow
from the marriage of a man with the daughter of
his mother’s brother thus differ for a man and
a woman, but if, as is usual, a man may marry
the daughter either of his mother’s brother or of
his father’s sister, these combinations of relationship
will hold good for both men and women.</p>

<p>Another and more remote consequence of the
cross-cousin marriage, if this become an established
institution, is that the relationships of mother’s
brother and father’s sister’s husband will come to
be combined in one and the same person, and that
there will be a similar combination of the relationships
of father’s sister and mother’s brother’s wife.
If the cross-cousin marriage be the habitual
custom, <i>B</i> and <i>b</i> in Diagram 1 will be brother and
sister; in consequence <i>A</i> will be at once the
mother’s brother and the father’s sister’s husband
of <i>C</i>, while <i>b</i> will be both his father’s sister and his
mother’s brother’s wife. Since, however, the
mother’s brother is also the father-in-law, and the
father’s sister the mother-in-law, three different
relationships will be combined in each case.
Through the cross-cousin marriage the relationships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of mother’s brother, father’s sister’s husband and
father-in-law will be combined in one and the same
person, and the relationships of father’s sister,
mother’s brother’s wife and mother-in-law will be
similarly combined.</p>

<p>In many places where we know the cross-cousin
marriage to be an established institution, we find
just those common designations which I have just
described. Thus, in the Mbau dialect of Fiji the
word <i>vungo</i> is applied to the mother’s brother, the
husband of the father’s sister and the father-in-law.
The word <i>nganei</i> is used for the father’s
sister, the mother’s brother’s wife and the mother-in-law.
The term <i>tavale</i> is used by a man for the
son of the mother’s brother or of the father’s sister
as well as for the wife’s brother and the sister’s
husband. <i>Ndavola</i> is used not only for the child
of the mother’s brother or father’s sister when
differing in sex from the speaker, but this word
is also used by a man for his wife’s sister and
his brother’s wife, and by a woman for her
husband’s brother and her sister’s husband. Every
one of these details of the Mbau system is the direct
and inevitable consequence of the cross-cousin
marriage, if it become an established and habitual
practice.</p>

<p>This Fijian system does not stand alone in
Melanesia. In the southern islands of the New
Hebrides, in Tanna, Eromanga, Anaiteum and
Aniwa, the cross-cousin marriage is practised and
their systems of relationship have features similar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
those of Fiji. Thus, in Anaiteum the word <i>matak</i>
applies to the mother’s brother, the father’s sister’s
husband and the father-in-law, while the word
<i>engak</i> used for the cross-cousin is not only used
for the wife’s sister and the brother’s wife, but also
for the wife herself.</p>

<p>Again, in the island of Guadalcanar in the
Solomons the system of relationship is just such as
would result from the cross-cousin marriage. One
term, <i>nia</i>, is used for the mother’s brother and
the wife’s father, and probably also for the father’s
sister’s husband and the husband’s father, though
my stay in the island was not long enough to enable
me to collect sufficient genealogical material to
demonstrate these points completely. Similarly,
<i>tarunga</i> includes in its connotation the father’s
sister, the mother’s brother’s wife and the wife’s
mother, and probably also the husband’s mother,
while the word <i>iva</i> is used for both cross-cousins
and brothers- and sisters-in-law. Corresponding
to this terminology there seemed to be no doubt
that it was the custom for a man to marry the
daughter of his mother’s brother or his father’s
sister, though I was not able to demonstrate this
form of marriage genealogically.</p>

<p>These three regions, Fiji, the southern New
Hebrides and Guadalcanar, are the only parts of
Melanesia included in my survey where I found the
practice of the cross-cousin marriage, and in all
three regions the systems of relationship are just
such as would follow from this form of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now turn to inquire how far it is possible
to explain these features of Melanesian systems
of relationship by psychological similarity. If it
were not for the cross-cousin marriage, what
can there be to give the mother’s brother a
greater psychological similarity to the father-in-law
than the father’s brother, or the father’s sister
a greater similarity to the mother-in-law than the
mother’s sister? Why should it be two special
kinds of cousin who are classed with two special
kinds of brother- and sister-in-law or with the
husband or wife? Once granted the presence of
the cross-cousin marriage, and there are psychological
similarities certainly, though even here the
matter is not quite straightforward from the point
of view of the believer in their importance, for we
have to do not merely with the similarity of two
relatives, but with their identity, with the combination
of two or more relationships in one and
the same person. Even if we put this on one side,
however, it remains to ask how it is possible to
say that terms of relationship do not reflect
sociology, if such psychological similarities are
themselves the result of the cross-cousin marriage?
What point is there in bringing in hypothetical
psychological similarities which are only at the best
intermediate links in the chain of causation connecting
the terminology of relationship with antecedent
social conditions?</p>

<p>If you concede the causal relation between the
characteristic features of a Fijian or Anaiteum or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Guadalcanar system and the cross-cousin marriage,
there can be no question that it is the cross-cousin
marriage which is the antecedent and the features
of the system of relationship the consequences. I
do not suppose that, even in this subject, there will
be found anyone to claim that the Fijians took to
marrying their cross-cousins because such a
marriage was suggested to them by the nature of
their system of relationship. We have to do in
this case, not merely with one or two features which
might be the consequence of the cross-cousin
marriage, but with a large and complicated meshwork
of resemblances and differences in the nomenclature
of relationship, each and every element of
which follows directly from such a marriage, while
no one of the systems I have considered possesses
a single feature which is not compatible with social
conditions arising out of this marriage. Apart from
quantitative verification, I doubt whether it would
be possible in the whole range of science to find a
case where we can be more confident that one
phenomenon has been conditioned by another. I
feel almost guilty of wasting your time by going
into it so fully, and should hardly have ventured
to do so if this case of social causation had not
been explicitly denied by one with so high a
reputation as Professor Kroeber. I hope, however,
that the argument will be useful as an example of
the method I shall apply to other cases in which
the evidence is less conclusive.</p>

<p>The features of terminology which follow from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the cross-cousin marriage were known to Morgan,
being present in three of the systems he recorded
from Southern India and in the Fijian system
collected for him by Mr. Fison. The earliest reference<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
to the cross-cousin marriage which I have
been able to discover is among the Gonds of Central
India. This marriage was recorded in 1870, which,
though earlier than the appearance of Morgan’s
book, was after it had been accepted for publication,
so that I think we can be confident that Morgan
was unacquainted with the form of marriage
which would have explained the peculiar features
of the Indian and Fijian systems. It is evident,
however, that Morgan was so absorbed in his
demonstration of the similarity of these systems
to those of America that he paid but little, if
any, attention to their peculiarities. He thus lost
a great opportunity; if he had attended to these
peculiarities and had seen their meaning, he might
have predicted a form of marriage which would soon
afterwards have been independently discovered.
Such an example of successful prediction would
have forced the social significance of the terminology
of relationship upon the attention of students
in such a way that we should have been spared
much of the controversy which has so long
obstructed progress in this branch of sociology. It
must at the very least have acted as a stimulus to
the collection of systems of relationship. It would
hardly have been possible that now, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
forty years after the appearance of Morgan’s book,
we are still in complete ignorance of the terminology
of relationship of many peoples about whom
volumes have been written. It would seem impossible,
for instance, that our knowledge of Indian
systems of relationship could have been what it
is to-day. India would have been the country in
which the success of Morgan’s prediction would
first have shown itself, and such an event must have
prevented the almost total neglect which the
subject of relationship has suffered at the hands of
students of Indian sociology.</p>

<h2>LECTURE II</h2>


<p>In my last lecture I began the demonstration of
the dependence of the classificatory terminology of
relationship upon social institutions by showing
how a number of terms used in several parts of
Melanesia have been determined by the cross-cousin
marriage. I showed that in places where
the cross-cousin marriage is practised there are not
merely one or two, but large groups of, terms of
relationship which are exactly such as would follow
from this form of marriage. To-day I begin by
considering other forms of Melanesian marriage
which bring out almost as clearly and conclusively
the dependence of the classificatory terminology
upon social conditions.</p>

<p>The systems of relationship of the Banks Islands
possess certain very remarkable features which were
first recorded by Dr. Codrington.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Put very
shortly, it may be stated that cross-cousins stand
to one another in the relation of parent and child,
or, more exactly, cross-cousins apply to one another
terms of relationship which are otherwise used
between parents and children. A man applies to
his mother’s brother’s children the term which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
otherwise uses for his own children, and, conversely,
a person applies to his father’s sister’s son a term he
otherwise uses for his father. Thus, in the following
diagram, <i>C</i> will apply to <i>D</i> and <i>e</i> the terms
which are in general use for a son and daughter,
while <i>D</i> and <i>e</i> will apply to <i>C</i> the term they otherwise
use for their father.</p>

<div>
<p class="center smcap">Diagram 2.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/zill_t029.png" width="500" height="106" alt="" />
</div>
</div>

<p>In most forms of the classificatory system members
of different generations are denoted in wholly
different ways and belong to different classes,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but
here we have a case in which persons of the same
generation as the speaker are classed with those of
an older or a younger generation.</p>

<p>I will first ask you to consider to what kind of
psychological similarity such a practice can be due.
What kind of psychological similarity can there
be between one special kind of cousin and the
father, and between another special kind of cousin
and a son or daughter? If the puzzle as put in
this form does not seem capable of a satisfactory
answer, let us turn to see if the Banks Islanders
practise any social custom to which this peculiar
terminology can have been due. In the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Ganviviris told to Dr. Codrington in these islands<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
an incident occurs in which a man hands over
one of his wives to his sister’s son, or, in other
words, in which a man marries one of the wives of
his mother’s brother. Inquiries showed, not only
that this form of marriage was once widely current
in the islands, but that it still persists though in
a modified form. The Christianity of the natives
does not now permit a man to have superfluous
wives whom he can pass on to his sister’s sons, but
it is still the orthodox, and indeed I was told the
popular, custom to marry the widow of the
mother’s brother. It seemed that in the old days
a man would take the widow of his mother’s
brother in addition to any wife or wives he might
already have. Though this is no longer allowed,
the leaning towards this form of marriage is so
strong that after fifty years of external influence a
young man still marries the widow of his mother’s
brother, sometimes in preference to a girl of his
own age. Indeed, there was reason to believe that
there was an obligation to do so, if the deceased
husband had a nephew who was not yet married.
The peculiar features of the terminology of relationship
in these islands are exactly such as would follow
from this form of marriage. If, in Diagram 2,
<i>C</i> marries <i>b</i>, the wife or widow of his mother’s
brother, and thereby comes to occupy the social
position of his uncle <i>A</i>, the children of the uncle,
<i>D</i> and <i>e</i>, will come to stand to him in the relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of children, while he, who had previously been the
father’s sister’s son of <i>D</i> and <i>e</i>, will now become
their father. An exceptional form of the classificatory
system, in which there is a departure from
the usual rule limiting a term of relationship to
members of the same generation, is found to be
the natural consequence of a social regulation
which enjoins the marriage of persons belonging to
different generations.</p>

<p>The next step in the process of demonstrating
the social significance of the classificatory system of
relationship will take us to the island of Pentecost
in the northern New Hebrides. When I recorded
the system of this island, I found it to have so
bizarre and complex a character that I could hardly
believe at first it could be other than the result
of a ludicrous misunderstanding between myself
and my seemingly intelligent and trustworthy
informants. Nevertheless, the records obtained from
two independent witnesses, and based on separate
pedigrees, agreed so closely even in the details
which seemed most improbable that I felt confident
that the whole construction could not be so mad
as it seemed. This confidence was strengthened
by finding that some of its features were of the
same order of peculiarity as others which I had
already found in a set of Fijian systems I have yet
to consider. There were certain features which
brought relatives separated by two generations into
one category; the mother’s mother, for instance,
received the same designation as the elder sister;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the wife’s mother the same as the daughter; the
wife’s brother the same as the daughter’s son. The
only conclusion I was then able to formulate was
that these features were the result of some social
institution resembling the matrimonial classes of
Australia, which would have the effect of putting
persons of alternate generations into one social
category.</p>

<p>This idea was supported by the system of
relationship of the Dieri of Australia which
possesses at least one feature similar to those of
Pentecost, a fact I happened to remember at the
time because Mr. N. W. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> had used it as
the basis of a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument to
show that terms of relationship do not express
kinship. The interest of the Pentecost system
seemed at first to lie in the possibility thus opened
of bringing Melanesian into relation with Australian
sociology, a hope which was the more promising
in that the people of Pentecost and the Dieri
resemble one another in the general character of
their social organisation, each being organised on
the dual basis with matrilineal descent. When in
Pentecost, however, I was unable to get further
than this, and the details of the system remained
wholly inexplicable.</p>

<p>The meaning of some of the peculiarities of the
Pentecost system became clear when I reached the
Banks Islands; they were of the same kind as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
those I have already considered as characteristic
of these islands. When I had discovered the
dependence of these features upon the marriage of
a man with the wife of his mother’s brother, it
became evident that not only these, but certain
other features of the Pentecost system, were
capable of being accounted for by this kind of
marriage. The peculiar features of the Pentecost
system could be divided into two groups, and all
the members of one group could be accounted for
by the marriage with the mother’s brother’s wife.
All these features had the character in common
that persons of the generation immediately above
or below that of the speaker were classed in nomenclature
with relatives of the same generation.</p>

<p>The other group consisted of terms in which
persons two generations apart were classed with
relatives of the same generation. Since the first
group of correspondences had been explained by
a marriage between persons one generation apart,
it should have been obvious that the classing
together of persons two generations apart might
have been the result of marriage between persons
two generations apart. The idea of a society in
which marriages between those having the status
of grandparents and grandchildren were habitual
must have seemed so unlikely that, if it entered
my mind at all, it must have been at once
dismissed. The clue only came later from a
man named John Pantutun, a native of the
Banks Islands, who had been a teacher in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Pentecost. In talking to me he often mentioned
in a most instructive manner resemblances and
differences between the customs of his own island
and those he had observed in Pentecost. One day
he let fall the observation with just such a manner
as that in which we so often accuse neighbouring
nations of ridiculous or disgusting practices, “O!
Raga!<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> That is the place where they marry their
granddaughters.” I saw at once that he had given
me a possible explanation of the peculiar features
of the system of the island. By that time I had
forgotten the details of the Pentecost system, and
it occurred to me that it would be interesting, not
immediately to consult my note-books, but to
endeavour to construct a system of relationship
which would be the result of marriage with a
granddaughter, and then to see how far my
theoretical construction agreed with the terminology
I had recorded. The first question which
arose was with which kind of granddaughter the
marriage had been practised, with the son’s
daughter or with the daughter’s daughter, and this
was a question readily answered by means of a
consideration arising out of the nature of the social
organisation of Pentecost.</p>

<p>The society of this island is organised on the
dual basis with matrilineal descent in which a man
must marry a woman of the opposite moiety.
Diagram 3, in which <i>A</i> and <i>a</i> stand for men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
women of one moiety, and <i>B</i> and <i>b</i> for those of
the other moiety, shows that a marriage between
a man and his son’s daughter would be out of the
question, for it would be a case of <i>A</i> marrying <i>a</i>.
It was evident that the marriage, the consequences
of which I had to formulate, must have been one
in which a man married his daughter’s daughter.</p>

<div>
<p class="center smcap">Diagram 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/zill_t035a.png" width="500" height="146" alt="" />
</div></div>

<p>It would take too long to go through the whole
set of relationships, and I choose only a few
examples which I illustrate by the following
diagram:</p>

<div>
<p class="center smcap">Diagram 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/zill_t035b.png" width="400" height="217" alt="" />
</div></div>

<p>This diagram shows that if <i>A</i> marries <i>e</i>, <i>c</i>, who
previous to the marriage had been only the
daughter of <i>A</i>, now becomes also his wife’s
mother; and <i>D</i>, who had previously been his
daughter’s husband, now becomes his wife’s father.
Similarly, <i>F</i>, who before the new marriage was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
daughter’s son of <i>A</i>, now becomes the brother of his
wife, while <i>f</i>, his daughter’s daughter, becomes his
wife’s sister. Lastly, if we assume that it would
be the elder daughters of the daughter who would
be married by their grandfathers, <i>e</i>, who before
the marriage had been the elder sister of <i>F</i> and <i>f</i>,
now comes through her marriage to occupy the
position of their mother’s mother.</p>

<p>When, after making these deductions, I examined
my record of the Pentecost terms, I found
that its terminology corresponded exactly with
those which had been deduced. The wife’s mother
and the daughter were both called <i>nitu</i>. The
daughter’s husband and the wife’s father were
both <i>bwaliga</i>. The daughter’s children were
called <i>mabi</i>, and this term was also used for the
brother and sister of the wife. Lastly, the mother’s
mother was found to be classed with the elder
sister, both being called <i>tuaga</i>.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity of demonstration I
have assumed that a man marries his own daughter’s
daughter, but through the classificatory principle
all the features I have described would follow
equally well if a man married the granddaughter
of his brother, either in the narrow or the classificatory
sense. There was one correspondence,
according to which both the husband’s brother and
the mother’s father were called <i>sibi</i>, which does not
follow from the marriage with the own granddaughter,
but would be the natural result of
marriage with the daughter’s daughter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
brother&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, with a marriage in which <i>e</i> was
married by <i>A’s</i> brother.</p>

<p>I hope these examples will be sufficient to show
how a number of features which might otherwise
seem so absurd as to suggest a system of relationship
gone mad become natural and intelligible,
even obvious, if it were once the established
practice of the people to marry the daughter’s
daughter of the brother.</p>

<p>Such inquiries as I was able to make confirmed
the conclusion that the Pentecost marriage was
with the granddaughter of the brother rather than
with the daughter of the daughter herself. After
I had been put on the track of the explanation by
John Pantutun I had the chance of talking to only
one native of Pentecost, unfortunately not a very
good informant. From his evidence it appeared
that the marriage I had inferred from the system
of relationship even now occurs in the island, but
only with the granddaughter of the brother, and
that marriage with the own granddaughter is
forbidden. The evidence is not as complete as I
should like, but it points to the actual existence in
the island of a peculiar form of marriage from
which the extraordinary features of its system of
relationship directly follow.</p>

<p>When I returned to England I found that this
marriage was not unique, but had been recorded
among the Dieri of Australia,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> where, as I have
already mentioned, it is associated with peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
features of nomenclature resembling those of
Pentecost.</p>

<p>I must again ask, how are you going to explain
the features of the Pentecost system psychologically?
What psychological resemblance is there
between a grandmother and a sister, between
a mother-in-law and a daughter, between a
brother-in-law and a grandfather? Apart from
some special form of social relationship, there can
be no such resemblances. Further, if there were
such psychological resemblances, why should we
know of their influence on nomenclature only in
Pentecost and among the Dieri? The features to
be explained are definitely known to exist in only
two systems of the world, and it is only among the
peoples who use these two systems that we have
any evidence of that extraordinary form of marriage
of which they would be the natural consequence.</p>



<p class="tb">I have now tried to show the dependence of
special features of the classificatory system of
relationship upon special social conditions. If I
have succeeded in this I shall have gone far towards
the accomplishment of one of the main purposes of
these lectures. They have, however, another purpose,
viz., to inquire how far we are justified in
inferring the existence of a social institution of
which we have no direct evidence when we find
features of the nomenclature of relationship which
would result from such an institution. I have now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to enter upon this part of my subject, and I think
it will be instructive to take you at once to a
case in which I believe that an extraordinary form
of marriage can be established as a feature of the
past history of a people, although at the present
moment any direct evidence for the existence of
such a marriage is wholly lacking.</p>

<p>When I was in the interior of Viti Levu, one of
the Fijian islands, I discovered the existence of
certain systems of relationship which differed
fundamentally from the only Fijian systems previously
known. Any features referable to the
cross-cousin marriage were completely absent, but
in their place were others, one of which I have
already mentioned, which brought into one class
relatives two generations apart. The father’s
father received the same designation as the elder
brother, and the son’s wife was called by the same
term as the mother. As I have already said, my
first conclusion was that these terms were the
survivals of forms of social organisation resembling
the matrimonial classes of Australia, but as soon as
I had worked out the explanation of the Pentecost
system, it became evident that the Fijian peculiarities
would have to be explained on similar lines.
At first I thought it probable that the difference
between the Pentecost and Fijian systems was due
to the difference in the mode of descent in the
two places. For long I tried to work out schemes
whereby a change from the matrilineal descent of
Pentecost to the patrilineal condition of Fiji could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have had as one of its consequences a change from
a correspondence in nomenclature between the
mother’s mother and the elder sister to one in
which the common nomenclature applied to the
father’s father and the elder brother. It is an
interesting example of the strength of a preconceived
opinion, and of some measure of the belief
in the impossibility of customs not practised by
ourselves, that for more than two years I failed to
see an obvious alternative explanation, although I
returned to the subject again and again. The clue
came at last from the system of Buin, in the island
of Bougainville, recorded by Dr. Thurnwald.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
nomenclature of this system agreed with that of
inland Fiji in having one term for the father’s
father and the elder brother, but since the people
of Buin still practice matrilineal descent, it was
evident that I had been on a false track in
supposing the correspondence to have been the
result of a change in the mode of descent. Once
turned into a fresh path by the necessity of showing
how the correspondence could have arisen out
of a matrilineal condition, it was not long before
I saw how it might be accounted for in a very
different way. I saw that the correspondence
would be the natural result of a form of social
organisation in which it was the practice to marry
a grandmother, viz., the wife of the father’s
father. Not only did this form of marriage explain
the second peculiar feature of the Fijian system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
viz., the classing of the son’s wife with the mother,
but it would also account for several features of the
Buin system which would otherwise be difficult to
understand.</p>

<div>
<p class="center smcap">Diagram 5.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/zill_t041.png" width="400" height="144" alt="" />
</div></div>

<p>If, as shown in Diagram 5, <i>E</i> marries <i>b</i>, the
wife or widow of his father’s father, he, who had
previously been the elder brother of <i>F</i> and <i>f</i>, now
comes to occupy the position of their father’s
father, while <i>d</i>, the mother of <i>E</i>, will now come to
stand to him in the relationship of son’s wife.</p>

<p>I need only mention here one of the features of
the Buin system which can be accounted for by
means of this marriage. The term <i>mamai</i> is used,
not only for the elder sister and for the elder
brother’s wife, but it is also applied to the
father’s mother; that is, the wife of the elder
brother is designated by the same term as the wife
of the father’s father, exactly as must happen if
<i>E</i> marries <i>b</i>, the wife of his father’s father. A
number of extraordinary features from two Melanesian
islands collected by two independent workers
fit into a coherent scheme if they have been the
result of a marriage in which a man gives one of
his wives to his son’s son during his life, or in
which this woman is taken to wife by her husband’s
grandson when she becomes a widow. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
practice were ever sufficiently habitual to become
the basis of the system of relationship, we can be
confident that it is the former of these two
alternatives with which we have to do.</p>

<p>If you are still so under the domination of ideas
derived from your own social surroundings that you
cannot believe in such a marriage, I would remind
you that there is definite evidence from the Banks
Islands that men used to hand over wives to their
sisters’ sons. It is not taking us so much into the
unknown as it might appear to suppose that they
once also gave their wives to their sons’ sons.</p>

<p>I have taken this case somewhat out of its proper
place in my argument because the evidence is so
closely connected with that by means of which I
have shown the relation between features of
systems of relationship and peculiar forms of
marriage in Melanesia. I have now to return to
the more sober task of considering how far we are
justified in inferring the former existence of
marriage institutions when we find features of
systems of relationship of which they would have
been the natural consequence. It is evident that,
whenever we find such a feature as common
nomenclature for a grandmother and a sister or
for a cross-cousin and a parent, it should suggest
to us the possibility of such marriage regulations
as those of Pentecost and the Banks Islands.
But such common designations might have arisen
in some other way, and in order to establish the
existence of such forms of marriage in the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
history of the people, we must have criteria to
guide us when we are considering whether a given
feature of the terminology of relationship is or is
not a survival of a marriage institution.</p>

<p>I will return to the cross-cousin marriage for my
examples. The task before us is to inquire how
far such features of relationship as exist in Fiji,
Anaiteum or Guadalcanar, in conjunction with the
cross-cousin marriage, will justify us in inferring
the former existence of this form of marriage in
places where it is not now practised.</p>

<p>If there be found among any people all the
characteristic features of a coastal Fijian or of an
Anaiteum system, I think few will be found to
doubt the former existence of the cross-cousin
marriage. It would seem almost inconceivable that
there should ever have existed any other conditions,
whether social or psychological, which could have
produced this special combination of peculiar uses
of terms of relationship. It is when some only of
these features are present that there will arise any
serious doubt whether they are to be regarded as
survivals of the former existence of the cross-cousin
marriage.</p>

<p>One consideration I must point out at once.
Certain of the features which follow from the
cross-cousin marriage may be the result of another
marriage regulation. In some parts of the world
there exists a custom of exchanging brothers and
sisters, so that, when a man marries a woman, his
sister marries his wife’s brother. As the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
this custom the mother’s brother and the father’s
sister’s husband will come to be one and the same
person, and the father’s sister will become also the
mother’s brother’s wife.</p>

<p>This form of marriage exists among the western
people of Torres Straits,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and is accompanied by
features of the system of relationship which would
follow from the practice. The mother’s brother is
classed with the father’s sister’s husband as <i>wad-wam</i>,
but there is an alternative term for the
father’s sister’s husband and there was no evidence
that the mother’s brother’s wife was classed with
the father’s sister. It seemed possible that the
classing together of the mother’s brother and the
father’s sister’s husband was not a constant feature
of the system of relationship, but only occurred in
cases where the custom of exchange had made it
necessary. The case, however, is sufficient to show
that two of the correspondences which follow
from the cross-cousin marriage may be the result
of another kind of marriage. If we accept the
social causation of such features and find these
correspondences alone, it would still remain an
open question whether they were the results of the
custom of exchange or of the marriage of cross-cousins.
The custom of exchange, however, is
wholly incapable of accounting for the use of a
common term for the mother’s brother and the
father-in-law, for the father’s sister and the mother-in-law,
or for cross-cousins and brothers- or sisters-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>in-law.
It is only when these correspondences
are present that there will be any decisive reason
for inferring the former existence of the cross-cousin
marriage.</p>

<p>The first conclusion, then, is that some of the
features found in association with the cross-cousin
marriage are of greater value than others in
enabling us to infer the former existence of the
cross-cousin marriage where it no longer exists.
Next, the probability that such features as I am
considering are due to the former presence of the
cross-cousin marriage will be greatly heightened if
this form of marriage should exist among people
with allied cultures. An instance from Melanesia
will bring out this point clearly.</p>

<p>In the island of Florida in the Solomons it is
clear that the cross-cousin marriage is not now the
custom, and I could discover no tradition of its
existence in the past. One feature, however, of
the system of relationship is just such as would
follow from the cross-cousin marriage. Both the
wife’s mother and the wife of the mother’s brother
are called <i>vungo</i>.</p>

<p>Florida is not only near Guadalcanar where the
cross-cousin marriage is practised, (the two islands
are within sight of one another), but their cultures
are very closely related. In such a case the probability
that the single feature of the Florida system
which follows from the cross-cousin marriage has
actually had that form of marriage as its antecedent
becomes very great, and this conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
becomes still more probable when we find that in a
third island, Ysabel, closely allied in culture both
to Florida and Guadalcanar, there is a clear
tradition of the former practice of the cross-cousin
marriage although it is now only an occasional
event.</p>

<p>Again, in one district of San Cristoval in the
Solomons the term <i>fongo</i> is used both for the
father-in-law and the father’s sister’s husband, and
<i>kafongo</i> similarly denotes both the mother-in-law
and the mother’s brother’s wife. This island differs
more widely from Guadalcanar in culture than
Florida or Ysabel, but the evidence for the former
existence of the marriage in these islands gives
us more confidence in ascribing the common
designations of San Cristoval to the cross-cousin
marriage than would have been the case if
these common designations had been the only
examples of such possible survivals in the Solomons.
Speaking in more general terms, one may say that
the probability that the common nomenclature for
two relatives is the survival of a form of marriage
becomes the greater, the more similar is the general
culture in which the supposed survival is found
to that of a people who practise this form of
marriage. The case will be greatly strengthened if
there should be intermediate links between the
supposed survival and the still living institution.</p>

<p>When we find a feature such as that of the
Florida system among a people none of whose allies
in culture practise the cross-cousin marriage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
matter must be far more doubtful. In the
present state of our knowledge we are only justified
in making such a feature the basis of a working
hypothesis to stimulate research and encourage us
to look for other evidence in the neighbourhood of
the place where the feature has been found. Our
knowledge of the social institutions of the world is
not yet so complete that we can afford to neglect
any clue which may guide our steps.</p>

<p>I propose briefly to consider two regions, South
India and North America, to show how they differ
from this point of view.</p>

<p>The terms of relationship used in three<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of the
chief languages spoken by the people of South
India are exactly such as would follow from the
cross-cousin marriage. In Tamil<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the mother’s
brother, the father’s sister’s husband, and the
father of both husband and wife are all called <i>mama</i>,
and this term is also used for these relatives in
Telegu. In Canarese the mother’s brother and the
father-in-law are both called <i>mava</i>, but the father’s
sister’s husband fails to fall into line and is classed
with the father’s brother.</p>

<p>Similarly, the father’s sister, the mother’s
brother’s wife and the mother of both wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
husband are called <i>atta</i> in Telegu and <i>atte</i> in
Canarese, Tamil here spoiling the harmony by
having one term, <i>attai</i>, for the father’s sister and
another, <i>mami</i>, for the mother’s brother’s wife
and the mother-in-law. Since, however, the Tamil
term for the father’s sister is only another form of
the Telegu and Canarese words for the combined
relationships, the exception only serves to
strengthen the agreement with the condition which
would follow from the cross-cousin marriage.</p>

<p>The South Indian terms for cross-cousin and
brother- and sister-in-law are complicated by the
presence of distinctions dependent on the sex and
relative age of those who use them, but these complications
do not disguise how definitely the
terminology would follow from the cross-cousin
marriage. Thus, to take only two examples: a
Tamil man applies the term <i>maittuni</i> to the
daughters of his mother’s brother and of his
father’s sister as well as to his brother’s wife and
his wife’s sister, and a Canarese woman uses one
term for the sons of her mother’s brother and of
her father’s sister, for her husband’s brother and
her sister’s husband.</p>

<p>So far as we know, the cross-cousin marriage is
not now practised by the vast majority of those
who use these terms of relationship. If the
terminology has been the result of the cross-cousin
marriage, it is only a survival of an ancient social
condition in which this form of marriage was
habitual. That it is such a survival, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
becomes certain when we find the cross-cousin
marriage still persisting in many parts of South
India, and that among one such people at least,
the Todas,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> this form of marriage is associated with
a system of relationship agreeing both in its
structure and linguistic character with that of the
Tamils. I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> brought together the
evidence for the former prevalence of this form
of marriage in India, but even if there were no
evidence, the terminology of relationship is so
exactly such as would follow from the cross-cousin
marriage that we can be certain that this form of
marriage was once the habitual custom of the
people of South India.</p>

<p>While South India thus provides a good example
of a case in which we can confidently infer the
former existence of the cross-cousin marriage from
the terminology of relationship, the evidence from
North America is of a kind which gives to such an
inference only a certain degree of probability. In
this case it is necessary to suspend judgment and
await further evidence before coming to a positive
conclusion.</p>

<p>I will begin with a very doubtful feature which
comes from an Athapascan tribe, the Red Knives<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
(probably that now called Yellow Knife). These
people use a common term, <i>set-so</i>, for the father’s
sister, the mother’s brother’s wife, the wife’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mother and the husband’s mother, a usage which
would be the necessary result of the cross-cousin
marriage. Against this, however, is to be put the
fact that there are three different terms for the
corresponding male relatives, the two kinds of
father-in-law being called <i>seth-a</i>, the mother’s
brother <i>ser-a</i>, and the father’s sister’s husband <i>sel-the-ne</i>.
Further, the term <i>set-so</i>, the common use
of which for the aunt and mother-in-law seems to
indicate the cross-cousin marriage, is also applied
by a man to his brother’s wife and his wife’s sister,
features which cannot possibly be the result of this
form of marriage. These features show, either
that the terminology has arisen in some other way,
or that there has been some additional social
factor in operation which has greatly modified
a nomenclature derived from the cross-cousin
marriage.</p>

<p>A stronger case is presented by the terminology
of three branches of the Cree tribe, also recorded by
Morgan. In all three systems, one term, <i>ne-sis</i> or
<i>nee-sis</i>, is used for the mother’s brother, the father’s
sister’s husband, the wife’s father and the husband’s
father; while the term <i>nis-si-goos</i> applies to
the father’s sister, the mother’s brother’s wife and
the two kinds of mother-in-law. These usages are
exactly such as would follow from the cross-cousin
marriage. The terms for the sister’s son of a man
and the brother’s son of a woman, however, differ
from those used for the son-in-law, and there is also
no correspondence between the terms for cross-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>cousin
and any kind of brother- or sister-in-law.
The case points more definitely to the cross-cousin
marriage than in the case of the Red Knives, but
yet lacks the completeness which would allow us
to make the inference with confidence.</p>

<p>The Assiniboin have a common term, <i>me-toh-we</i>,
used for the father’s sister, the mother’s
brother’s wife and the two kinds of mother-in-law,
and also a common term, <i>me-nake-she</i>, for the
mother’s brother and the father’s sister’s husband,
but the latter differs from the word, <i>me-to-ga-she</i>,
used for the father of husband or wife. The case
here is decidedly stronger than among the Red
Knives, but is less complete than among the
Crees.</p>

<p>Among a number of branches of the Dakotas the
evidence is of a different kind, being derived from
similar nomenclature for the cross-cousin and
certain kinds of brother- and sister-in-law. Morgan<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
has recorded eight systems, all of which show the
features in question, but I will consider here only
that of the Isauntie or Santee Dakotas, which was
collected for him by the Rev. S. R. Riggs. Riggs<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and Dorsey<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> have given independent accounts of
this system which are far less complete than
that given by Morgan, but agree with it in all
essentials.</p>

<p>In this system a man calls the son of his mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
brother or of his father’s sister <i>ta-hang-she</i> or
<i>tang-hang-she</i>, while his wife’s brother and his
sister’s husband are <i>ta-hang</i> or <i>tang-hang</i>.
Similarly, a woman calls her cross-cousin <i>she-chay-she</i>,
while her husband’s brother and her sister’s
husband are called <i>she-chay</i>. The terms for
brothers-in-law are thus the same as those for cross-cousins
with the omission of the suffix <i>she</i>. One
of these resemblances, that when a woman is speaking,
has been cited by Professor Kroeber<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as an
example of the psychological causation of such
features of relationship as I am considering in these
lectures. He rejects its dependence on the cross-cousin
marriage and refers the resemblance to the
psychological similarity between a woman’s cousin
and her brother-in-law in that both are collateral
relatives alike in sex, of the same generation as the
speaker, but different from her in sex.</p>

<p>As we have seen, however, the Dakota correspondence
is not an isolated occurrence, but fits in
with a number of other features of the systems of
cognate peoples to form a body of evidence pointing
to the former prevalence of the cross-cousin
marriage.</p>

<p>There is also indirect evidence leading in the
same direction. In Melanesia there is reason to
believe that the cross-cousin marriage stands in a
definite relation to another form of marriage, that
with the wife of the mother’s brother. If there
should be evidence for the former existence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
this marriage in North America, it would increase
the probability in favour of the cross-cousin
marriage.</p>

<p>Among a number of peoples, some of whom
form part of the Sioux, including the Minnitarees,
Crows, Choctas, Creeks, Cherokees and Pawnees,
cross-cousins are classed with parents and children
exactly as in the Banks Islands, and exactly as in
those islands, it is the son of the father’s sister who
is classed with the father, and the children of the
mother’s brother who are classed with sons or
daughters. Further, among the Pawnees the wife
of the mother’s brother is classed with the wife,
a feature also associated with the peculiar nomenclature
for cross-cousins in the Banks Islands. The
agreement is so close as to make it highly probable
that the American features of relationship have
been derived from a social institution of the same
kind as that to which the Melanesian features are
due, and that it was once the custom of these
American peoples to marry the wife of the
mother’s brother. Here, as in the case of the cross-cousin
marriage itself, the case rests entirely upon
the terminology of relationship, but we cannot
ignore the association in neighbouring parts of
North America of features of relationship which
would be the natural consequence of two forms of
marriage which are known to be associated together
elsewhere.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Miss Freire-Marreco for the
information that the Tewa of Hano, a Pueblo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tribe, call the father’s sister’s son <i>tada</i>, a term
otherwise used for the father, thus suggesting that
they also may once have practised marriage with
the wife of the mother’s brother. The use of this
term, however, is only one example of a practice
whereby all the males of the father’s clan are called
<i>tada</i>, irrespective of age and generation. The
common nomenclature for the father and the
father’s sister’s son among the Tewa thus differs
in character from the apparently similar nomenclature
of the Banks Islands and cannot have been
determined directly, perhaps not even remotely,
by marriage with the wife of the mother’s brother.
This raises the question whether the nomenclature
of the Sioux has not arisen out of a practice similar
to that of the Tewa. The terms for other relatives
recorded by Morgan show some evidence of the
widely generalised use of the Tewa, but such a
use cannot account for the classing of the wife of
the mother’s brother with the wife which occurs
among the Pawnees. Nevertheless, the Tewa
practice should keep us alive to the possibility that
the Sioux nomenclature may depend on some social
condition different from that which has been
effective in the Banks Islands in spite of the close
resemblance between the two.</p>

<p>The case for the former existence of the cross-cousin
marriage will be much strengthened if this
form of marriage should occur elsewhere in North
America. So far as I am aware, the only people
among whom it has been recorded are the Haidahs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of Queen Charlotte Island.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is a far cry from
this outpost of North American culture to Dakota,
but it may be noted that it is among the Crees
who formerly lived in the intermediate region of
Manitoba and Assiniboia that the traces of the
cross-cousin marriage are most definite. This mode
of distribution of the peoples whose terminology
of relationship bears evidence of the cross-cousin
marriage suggests that other intermediate links
may yet be found. Though the existing evidence
is inconclusive, it should be sufficient to stimulate
a search for other evidence which may make it
possible to decide whether or no the cross-cousin
marriage was once a widespread practice in North
America.</p>

<p>I can only consider one other kind of marriage
here. The discovery of so remarkable a union as
that with the daughter’s daughter in Pentecost
and the evidence pointing to a still more remarkable
marriage between those having the status of
grandparent and grandchild in Fiji and Buin have
naturally led me to look for similar evidence
elsewhere in Melanesia. Though there is nothing
conclusive, conditions are to be found here and
there which suggest the former existence of such
marriages.</p>

<p>When I was in the Solomons I met a native of
the Trobriand Islands, who told me that among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his people the term <i>tabu</i> was applied both to grandparents
and to the father’s sister’s child. I went
into the whole subject as fully as was possible with
only one witness, but in spite of his obvious intelligence
and good faith, I remained doubtful whether
the information was correct. The feature in question,
however, occurs in the list of Trobriand terms
drawn up for Dr. Seligmann<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> by Mr. Bellamy, and
with this double warrant it must be accepted. It
is a feature which would follow from marriage
with the daughter’s daughter, for by this marriage
one who was previously a father’s sister’s daughter
becomes the wife of a grandfather and thereby
attains the status of a grandparent. The feature
exists alone, and, further, it is combined with
other applications of the term which deprive it of
some of its significance; nevertheless, the fact that
a peculiar and exceptional feature of a Melanesian
system of relationship is such as would follow
naturally from a form of marriage which is practised
in another part of Melanesia cannot be passed
over. Standing alone, it would be wholly insufficient
to justify the conclusion that the marriage
with the daughter’s daughter was ever prevalent
among the Massim, but in place of expressing a
dogmatic denial, let us look for other features of
Massim sociology which may have been the results
of such a marriage.</p>

<p>In Wagawaga<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> there is a peculiar term, <i>warihi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which is used by men for other men of their own
generation and social group, but the term is also
applied by an old man or woman to one of a
younger generation. Again, in Tubetube<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the term
for a husband, <i>taubara</i>, is also a term for an old
man, and the term for the wife is also applied to
an old woman. These usages may be nothing more
than indications of respect for a husband or wife, or
of some mechanism which brought those differing
widely in age into one social category, but with the
clue provided by the Trobriand term of relationship
it becomes possible, though even now only possible,
that the Wagawaga and Tubetube customs may
have arisen out of a social condition in which it was
customary to have great disparity of age between
husbands and wives, and social relations between
old and young following from such disparity in the
age of consorts.</p>

<p>In Tubetube there is yet another piece of
evidence. Mr. Field<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> has recorded the existence
in this island of three named categories of persons,
two of which comprise relatives with whom
marriage is prohibited, while the third groups
together those with whom marriage is allowed.
The grandparents and grandchildren are included
in one of the two prohibited classes, so that we can
be confident that marriage between these relatives
does not now occur. The point to which I call
your attention is that the class of relative with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
whom marriage is allowed is called <i>kasoriegogoli</i>.
<i>Li</i> is the third person pronominal suffix, and we do
not know the meaning of <i>kasorie</i>, but <i>goga</i> is the
term used in Wagawaga and Wedau for the grandparents,
its place being taken by the usual Melanesian
term <i>tubu</i> in Tubetube. The term <i>kasoriegogoli</i>
applied to marriageable relatives thus contains
as one of its constituent elements a word
which is probably the ancient term for grandparent
in the island, since it is still used in this sense in
the closely allied societies of the mainland.</p>

<p>We have thus a number of independent facts
among the Massim, all of which would be the natural
outcome of marriage between persons of alternate
generations. To no one of them standing alone
could much importance be attached, but taken in
conjunction, they ought at least to suggest the
possibility of such a marriage, a possibility which
becomes the more probable when we consider that
the Massim show clear evidence of the dual
organisation of society with matrilineal descent
which is associated with the granddaughter marriage
of Pentecost and the Dieri of Australia.
It adds to the weight of the evidence that indications
of this peculiar form of marriage should be
found among a people whose social organisation so
closely resembles that in which the marriages
between persons of alternate generations elsewhere
occur.</p>

<p>I have no time for other examples. I hope to
have shown that there are cases in which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
possible to infer with certainty the ancient existence
of forms of marriage from the survival of
their results in the terminology of relationship. In
other cases, differences of culture or the absence of
intermediate links make it unjustifiable to infer the
ancient existence of the forms of marriage from
which features of terminology might be derived.
Other cases lie between the two, the confidence
with which a form of marriage can be inferred
varying with the degree of likeness of culture,
the distance in space, and the presence or absence
of other features of culture which may be related
to the form of marriage in question. Even in
the cases, however, where the inference is most
doubtful, we have no right dogmatically to deny
the origin of the terminology of relationship in
social conditions, but should keep each example
before an open mind, to guide and stimulate
inquiry in a region where ethnologists have till now
only scratched the surface covering a rich mine of
knowledge.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III</h2>


<p>Thus far in these lectures I have been content to
demonstrate the dependence of the terminology of
relationship upon forms of marriage. In spending
so much time upon this aspect of my subject I fear
that I may have been helping to strengthen a very
general misconception, for it is frequently supposed
that the sole aim of those who think as I
do is to explain systems of relationship by their
origin in forms of marriage. Marriage is only one
of the social institutions which have moulded the
terminology of relationship. It is, however, so
fundamental a social institution that it is difficult
to get far away from it in any argument which
deals with social organisation. In now passing to
other examples of the dependence of the terminology
of relationship upon social conditions, I
begin with one in which features of this terminology
have come about, not as the result of forms of
marriage, but of an attitude towards social regulations
connected with marriage. The instance I
have now to consider is closely allied to one which
Professor Kroeber has used as his pattern of the
psychological causation of the terminology of
relationship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Both in Polynesia and Melanesia it is not infrequent
for the father-in-law to be classed with the
father, the mother-in-law with the mother, the
brother-in-law with the brother, and the sister-in-law
with the sister. The Oceanic terminology of
relationship has two features which enable us to
study the exact nature of this process in more detail
than is possible with our own system. Oceanic
languages often distinguish carefully between
different kinds of brother- and sister-in-law, and,
if it be found that it is only certain kinds of brother- or
sister-in-law who are classed with the brother or
sister, we may thereby obtain a clue to the nature
of the process whereby the classing has come about.
Secondly, Oceanic terminology usually distinguishes
relationships between men or between women from
those between persons of different sex, and there
is a feature of the terminology employed when
brothers- or sisters-in-law are classed with brothers
or sisters in Oceania which throws much light on
the process whereby this common nomenclature
has come into use.</p>

<p>The first point to be noticed in the Oceanic
nomenclature of relationship is that not all
brothers- and sisters-in-law are classed with
brothers and sisters, but only those of different sex.
Thus, in Merlav, in the Banks Islands, it is only
the wife’s sister and a man’s brother’s wife who
are classed with the sister, and the husband’s
brother and a woman’s sister’s husband who are
classed with the brother, while there are special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
terms for other categories of relative whom we
include under the designations brother- and sister-in-law.
Similar conditions are general throughout
Melanesia. If, as Professor Kroeber has supposed,
the classing of the brother-in-law with the brother
be due to the psychological similarity of the
relationships, we ought to be able to discover why
this similarity should be greater between persons
of different sex than between persons of the same
sex.</p>

<p>If now we study our case from the Banks Islands
more closely and compare the social conditions in
Merlav with those of other islands of the group,
we find definite evidence, which it will not now
be possible to consider in detail, showing that
sexual relations were formerly allowed between a
man and his wife’s sisters and his brothers’ wives,
and that there is a definite association between the
classing of these relatives with the sister and the
cessation of such sexual relations. If such people
as the Melanesians wish to emphasise in the
strongest manner possible the impropriety of
sexual relations between a man and the sisters of
his wife, there is no way in which they can do it
more effectually than by classing these relatives
with a sister. To a Melanesian, as to other people
of rude culture, the use of a term otherwise applied
to a sister carries with it such deeply-seated associations
as to put sexual relations absolutely out of
the question. There is a large body of evidence
from southern Melanesia which suggests strongly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
if not conclusively, that the common nomenclature
I am now considering has arisen out of the social
need for emphasising the impropriety of relations
which were once habitual among the people.</p>

<p>The second feature of Melanesian terminology
which I have mentioned helps us to understand
how the common nomenclature has come about.
In most of the Melanesian cases in which a wife’s
sister is denoted by a term otherwise used for a
sister, or a husband’s brother by a term otherwise
used for a brother, the term employed is one
which is normally used between those of the same
sex. Thus, a man does not apply to his wife’s
sister the term which he himself uses for his sister,
but one which would be used by a woman of her
sister. In other words, a man uses for his wife’s
sister the term which is used for this relative by
his wife. This shows us how the common nomenclature
may have come into use. It suggests that
as sexual relations with the wife’s sister became no
longer orthodox, a man came to apply to this
woman the word with which he was already
familiar as a term for this relative from the mouth
of his wife. The special feature of Melanesian
nomenclature according to which terms of relationship
vary with the sex of the speaker here helps
us to understand how the common nomenclature
arose. The process is one in which psychological
factors evidently play an important part, but these
psychological factors are themselves the outcome
of a social process, viz., the change from a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>dition
of sexual communism to one in which sexual
relations are restricted to the partners of a marriage.
Such psychological factors as come into
action are only intermediate links in a chain of
causation in which the two ends are definitely social
processes or events, or, perhaps more correctly,
psychological concomitants of intermediate links
which are themselves social events. We should be
shutting our eyes to obvious features of these
Melanesian customs if we refused to recognise that
the terminology of relationship here “reflects”
sociology.</p>

<p>This leads me to question for a moment whether
it may not be the same with that custom of our
own society which Professor Kroeber has taken as
his example of the psychological causation of the
terminology of relationship. Is it as certain as
Professor Kroeber supposes that the classing of the
brother-in-law with the brother, or of the sister-in-law
with the sister, among ourselves does not
reflect sociology? We know that there are social
factors at work among us which give to these
relationships, and especially to that of wife’s sister,
a very great importance. If instead of stating
dogmatically that this feature of our own terminology
is due to the psychological similarity of the
relationships, Professor Kroeber’s mind had been
open even to the possibility of the working of social
causes, I think he might have been led to inquire
more closely into the distribution and exact character
of the practice in question. He might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
been led to see that we have here a problem for
exact inquiry. Such a custom among ourselves
must certainly own a cause different from that to
which I have ascribed the Melanesian practice, but
is it certain that there is no social practice among
ourselves which would lead to the classing of the
wife’s sister with the sister and the sister’s husband
of a woman with the brother? I will only point
to the practice of marrying the deceased wife’s
sister, and content myself with the remark that I
should be surprised if there were any general
tendency to class these relatives together by a
people among whom this form of marriage is the
orthodox and habitual custom.</p>

<p>Till now I have been dealing with relatively small
variations of the classificatory system. The varieties
I have so far considered are such as would arise
out of a common system if in one place there came
into vogue the cross-cousin marriage, in another
place marriage with the wife of the mother’s
brother, in another that with the granddaughter of
the brother or with the wife of the grandfather,
and in yet other places combinations of these forms
of marriage. I have now to consider whether it is
possible to refer the main varieties of the classificatory
system to social conditions; as an example
with which to begin, I choose one which is so
definite that it attracted the attention of Morgan,
viz., the variety of the classificatory system which
Morgan called “Malayan”. It is now generally
recognised that this term was badly chosen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
variety so called was known to Morgan through the
terminology of the Hawaiian Islands, and as the
system of these islands was not only the first to be
recorded, but is also that of which even now we have
the most complete record, I propose to use it as the
pattern and to speak of the Hawaiian system where
Morgan spoke of the Malayan. If now we compare
the Hawaiian system with the forms of the classificatory
system found in other parts of Oceania, in
Australia, India, Africa or America, we find that
it is characterised by its extreme simplicity and by
the fewness of its terms. Distinctions such as those
between the father’s brother and the mother’s
brother, between the father’s sister and the
mother’s sister, and between the children of
brothers or of sisters and the children of brother and
sister, distinctions which are so generally present
in the more usual forms of the classificatory system,
are here completely absent. The problem before
us is to discover whether the absence of these distinctions
can be referred to any social factors. If
not, we may be driven to suppose that there is
something in the structure of the Polynesian mind
which leads the Hawaiian and the Maori to see
similarities where most other peoples of rude culture
see differences.</p>

<p>The first point to be noted is that in Oceania
the distinction between the Hawaiian and the
more usual forms of the classificatory system does
not correspond with the distinction between the
Polynesian and Melanesian peoples. Systems are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to be found in Melanesia, as in the western Solomons,
which closely resemble that of Hawaii,
while there are Polynesian systems, such as those
of Tonga and Tikopia, which are so like those
of Melanesia that, if they had occurred there, they
would have attracted no special attention. The
difference between the two kinds of system is not
to be correlated with any difference of race.</p>

<p>Next, if we take Melanesian and Polynesian
systems as a whole, we find that they do not fall
into two sharply marked-off groups, but that there
are any number of intermediate gradations between
the two. It would be possible to arrange the
classificatory systems of Oceania in a series in which
it would not be possible to draw the line at any
point between the different varieties of system
which the two ends of the series seem to represent.
The question arises whether it is possible to find
any other series of transitions in Oceania which
runs parallel with the series connecting the two
varieties of system of relationship. There is no
doubt but that this question can be answered in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, there are two main varieties
of social organisation in Oceania, with an infinite
number of intermediate conditions. In one variety
marriage is regulated by some kind of clan-exogamy,
including under the term “clan” the
moieties of a dual organisation; in the other variety
marriage is regulated by kinship or genealogical
relationship. We know of no part of Melanesia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
where marriage is regulated solely by clan-exogamy,
but it is possible to arrange Melanesian and Polynesian
societies in a series according to the different
degrees in which the principles of genealogical
relationship is the determining factor in the regulation
of marriage. At one end of the series we
should have places like the Banks Islands, the
northern New Hebrides and the Santa Cruz
Islands, where the clan-organisation is so obviously
important that it was the only mechanism for the
regulation of marriage which was recognised even
by so skilful an observer as Dr. Codrington. At
the other end of the series we have places such as
the Hawaiian Islands and Eddystone Island in the
western Solomons, where only the barest traces of
a clan-organisation are to be found and where
marriage is regulated solely by genealogical
relationship. Between the two are numerous intermediate
cases, and the series so formed runs so
closely parallel to that representing the transitions
between different forms of the classificatory system
that it seems out of the question but that there
should be a relation between the two. Of all the
places where I have myself worked, the two in
which I failed to find any trace of the regulation
of marriage by means of a clan-organisation were
the Hawaiian Islands and Eddystone Island, and
the systems of both places were lacking in just
those distinctions the absence of which characterised
the Malayan system of Morgan. Only in
one point did the Eddystone system differ from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the Hawaiian. Though the mother’s brother was
classed in nomenclature with the father, there was
a term for the sister’s son, but it was so little used
that in a superficial survey it would have escaped
notice. Its use was so exceptional that many of
the islanders were doubtful about its proper
meaning. In other parts of the Solomons where
the clan-organisation persists, but where the
regulation of marriage by genealogical relationship
is equally, if not more, important, the systems of
relationship show intermediate characters. Thus,
in the island of Florida the mother’s brother was
distinguished from the father and there was a term
by means of which to distinguish cross-cousins from
other kinds of cousin, but the father’s sister was
classed with the mother, and it was habitual to
ignore the proper term for cross-cousins and to class
them in nomenclature with brothers and sisters and
with cousins of other kinds, as in the Hawaiian
system. One influential man even applied the
term for father to the mother’s brother; it was
evident that a change is even now in progress which
would have to go very little farther to make the
Florida system indistinguishable in structure from
that of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Among the western Papuo-Melanesians of New
Guinea, again, the systems of relationship come
very near to the Hawaiian type, and with this character
there is associated a very high degree of
importance of the regulation of marriage by
genealogical relationship and a vagueness of clan-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>organisation.
We have here so close a parallelism
between two series of social phenomena as to
supply as good an example as could be wished of
the application of the method of concomitant
variations in the domain of sociology.</p>

<p>The nature of these changes and their relation
to the general cultures of the peoples who use
the different forms of terminology show that the
transitions are to be associated with a progressive
change which has taken place in Oceania. In this
part of the world the classificatory system has been
the seat of a process of simplification starting from
the almost incredible complexity of Pentecost and
reaching the simplicity of such systems as those of
Eddystone or Mekeo. This process has gone hand
in hand with one in which the regulation of
marriage by some kind of clan-exogamy has
gradually been replaced by a mechanism based on
relationship as traced by means of pedigrees.</p>

<p>If this conclusion be accepted, it will follow that
the more widely distributed varieties of the classificatory
system of relationship are associated with
a social structure which has the exogamous social
group as its essential unit. This position has only
to be stated for it to become apparent how all
the main features of the classificatory system are
such as would follow directly from such a social
structure. Wherever the classificatory system is
found in association with a system of exogamous
social groups, the terms of relationship do not
apply merely to relatives with whom it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to trace genealogical relationship, but to all the
members of a clan of a given generation, even if no
such relationship with them can be traced. Thus,
a man will not only apply the term “father” to
all the brothers of his father, to all the sons’ sons
of his father’s father, and to all the sons’ sons’
sons of his father’s father’s father, to all the
husbands of his mother’s sisters and of his
mother’s mother’s granddaughters, etc., but he
will also apply the term to all the members of his
father’s clan of the same generation as his father
and to all the husbands of the women of the
mother’s clan of the same generation as the mother,
even when it is quite impossible to show any
genealogical relationship with them. All these and
the other main features of the classificatory system
become at once natural and intelligible if this
system had its origin in a social structure in which
exogamous social groups, such as the clan or
moiety, were even more completely and essentially
the social units than we know them to be to-day
among the peoples whose social systems have been
carefully studied. If you are dissatisfied with the
word “classificatory” as a term for the system of
relationship which is found in America, Africa,
India, Australia and Oceania, you would be perfectly
safe in calling it the “clan” system, and in
inferring the ancient presence of a social structure
based on the exogamous clan even if this structure
were no longer present.</p>

<p>Not only is the general character of the classi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ficatory
system exactly such as would be the consequence
of its origin in a social structure founded
on the exogamous social group, but many details
of these systems point in the same direction. Thus,
the rigorous distinctions between father’s brother
and mother’s brother, and between father’s sister
and mother’s sister, which are characteristic of the
usual forms of the classificatory system, are the
obvious consequence of the principle of exogamy.
If this principle be in action, these relatives must
always belong to different social groups, so that it
would be natural to distinguish them in nomenclature.</p>

<p>Further, there are certain features of the classificatory
system which suggest its origin in a special
form of exogamous social grouping, viz., that
usually known as the dual system in which there are
only two social groups or moieties. It is an almost
universal feature of the classificatory system that
the children of brothers are classed with the
children of sisters. A man applies the same term
to his mother’s sister’s children which he uses for
his father’s brother’s children, and the use of this
term, being the same as that used for a brother or
sister, carries with it the most rigorous prohibition
of marriage. Such a condition would not follow
necessarily from a social state in which there were
more than two social groups. If the society were
patrilineal, the children of two brothers would
necessarily belong to the same social group, so that
the principle of exogamy would prevent marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
between them, but if the women of the group had
married into different clans, there is no reason
arising out of the principle of exogamy which
should prevent marriage between their children or
lead to the use of a term common to them and the
children of brothers. Similarly, if the society were
matrilineal, the children of two sisters would necessarily
belong to the same social group, but this
would not be the case with the children of brothers
who might marry into different social groups.</p>

<p>If, however, there be only two social groups, the
case is very different. It would make no difference
whether descent were patrilineal or matrilineal. In
each case the children of two brothers or of two
sisters must belong to the same moiety, while the
children of brother and sister must belong to
different moieties. The children of two brothers
would be just as ineligible as consorts as the
children of two sisters. Similarly, it would be a
natural consequence of the dual organisation that
the mother’s brother’s children should be classed
with the father’s sister’s children, but this would
not be necessary if there were more than two social
groups.</p>

<p>I should have liked, if there were time, to deal
with other features of the classificatory system, but
must be content with these examples. I hope to
have succeeded in showing that the social causation
of the terminology of relationship goes far beyond
the mere dependence of features of the system on
special forms of marriage, and that the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the classificatory system as a whole has been determined
by its origin in a specific form of social
organisation. I propose now to leave the classificatory
system for a moment and inquire whether
another system of denoting and classifying relationships
may not similarly be shown to be determined
by social conditions. The system I shall consider
is our own. Let us examine this system in its
relation to the form of social organisation prevalent
among ourselves.</p>

<p>Just as among most peoples of rude culture the
clan or other exogamous group is the essential unit
of social organisation, so among ourselves this social
unit is the family, using this term for the group
consisting of a man, his wife, and their children.
If we examine our terms of relationship, we find
that those applied to individual persons and those
used in a narrow and well-defined sense are just
those in which the family is intimately concerned.
The terms father, mother, husband and wife,
brother and sister, are limited to members of the
family of the speaker, and the terms father-, mother-, brother-, and
sister-in-law to the members
of the family of the wife or husband in the same
narrowly restricted sense. Similarly, the terms
grandfather and grandmother are limited to the
parents of the father and mother, while the terms
grandson and granddaughter are only used of the
families of the children in the narrow sense. The
terms uncle and aunt, nephew and niece, are
used in a less restricted sense, but even these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
terms are only used of persons who stand in a
close relation to the family of the speaker. We
have only one term used with anything approaching
the wide connotation of classificatory terms
of relationship, and this term is used for a
group of relatives who have as their chief feature
in common that they are altogether outside the
proper circle of the family and have no social
obligations or privileges. They are as eligible for
marriage as any other members of the community,
and only in the very special cases I considered in
the first lecture are they brought into any kind of
legal relation. The dependence of our own use of
terms of relationship on the social institution of the
family seems to me so obvious that I find it difficult
to understand how anyone who has considered
these terms can put forward the view that the
terminology of relationship is not socially conditioned.
It seems to me that we have only to have
the proposition stated that the classificatory system
and our own are the outcome of the social institutions
of the clan and family respectively for the
social causation of such terminology to become conspicuous.
I find it difficult to understand why it
has not long before this been universally recognised.
I do not think we can have a better example
of the confusion and prejudice which have been
allowed to envelop the subject through the unfortunate
introduction of the problem of the
primitive promiscuity or monogamy of mankind.
It is not necessary to have an expert knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the classificatory system. It is only necessary to
consider the terms we have used almost from our
cradles in relation to their social setting to see how
the terminology of relationship has been determined
by that setting.</p>

<p>This brief study of our own terms of relationship
leads me to speak about the name by which our
system is generally known. Morgan called it the
“descriptive system,” and this term has been
generally adopted. I believe, however, that it is
wholly inappropriate. Those terms which apply
to one person and to one person only may be called
descriptive if you please, though even here the use
does not seem very happy. When we pass beyond
these, however, our terms are no whit more descriptive
than those of the classificatory system.
We speak of a grandfather, not of a father’s father
or a mother’s father, only distinguishing grandfathers
in this manner when it is necessary to
supplement our customary terminology by more
exact description. Similarly, we speak of a brother-in-law,
and only in exceptional circumstances do
we use forms of language which indicate whether
reference is being made to the brother of the
husband or wife or to the husband of a sister.
Such occasional usages do not make our system
descriptive, and if they be held to do so, the classificatory
system is just as descriptive as our own.
All those peoples who use the classificatory system
are capable of such exact description of relationship
as I have mentioned. Indeed, classificatory systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
are often more descriptive than our own. In some
forms of this system true descriptive terms are
found in habitual use. Thus, in the coastal systems
of Fiji the mother’s brother is often called <i>ngandina</i>
(<i>ngane</i>, sister of a man, and <i>tina</i>, mother), this
term being used in place of the <i>vungo</i> already
mentioned. Similar uses of descriptive terms occur
in other parts of Melanesia. Thus, in Santa Cruz
the father’s sister is called <i>inwerderde</i> (<i>inwe</i>, sister,
and <i>derde</i>, father). This relative is one for whom
Melanesian systems of relationship not infrequently
possess no special designation, and the use of a
descriptive term suggests a recent process which
has come into action in order to denote a relative
who had previously lacked any special designation.</p>

<p>If “descriptive” is thus an inappropriate name
for our own system, it will be necessary to find
another, and I should like boldly to recognise the
direct dependence of its characters on the institution
of the family and to speak of it as the “family system.”</p>

<p>While I thus reject the term “descriptive” as
a proper name for the terminology of relationship
with which we are especially familiar, it does not
follow that there may not be systems of denoting
relationship which properly deserve this title. In
Samoa a mode of denoting relatives is often used
in which the great majority of the terms are
descriptive. Thus, the only term which I could
obtain for the father’s brother’s son was <i>atalii o le
uso o le tama</i>, which is literally “son of the brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the father,” and there is some reason to suppose
that this descriptive usage has come into vogue
owing to the total inadequacy of the ancient
Samoan system to express relationships in which
the peoples are now interested.</p>

<p>The wide use of such descriptive terms is also
found in many systems of Europe, as in the Celtic
languages, in those of Scandinavia, in Lithuanian
and Esthonian.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> A similar mode of denoting
relationships is found in Semitic languages and
among the Shilluks and Dinkas of the Anglo-Egyptian
Sudan, and since it is from these peoples
that I have gained my own experience of descriptive
terminology, I propose to take them as my
examples.</p>

<p>In the Arabic system of relationship used in
Egypt many of the terms are descriptive; thus, the
father’s brother being called <i>’amm</i>, the father’s
brother’s wife is <i>mirat ’ammi</i>, the father’s brother’s
son <i>ibn ’ammi</i>, and the father’s brother’s daughter
<i>bint ’ammi</i>, and there is a similar usage for the
consorts and children of the father’s sister and of
the brother and sister of the mother.</p>

<p>Similarly, many Shilluk terms suggest a descriptive
character, the father’s brother being <i>wa</i>, the
wife of the father’s brother is <i>chiwa</i>, the father’s
brother’s son is <i>uwa</i>, and his daughter is <i>nyuwa</i>.
The father’s sister being <i>waja</i>, her son and
daughter are <i>uwaja</i> and <i>nyuwaja</i> respectively.
Similar descriptive terms are used by the Dinkas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
The father’s brother being <i>walen</i>, the father’s
brother’s son is <i>manwalen</i> and his daughter <i>yanwalen</i>;
the mother’s brother being <i>ninar</i>, the
mother’s brother’s son is <i>manninar</i> and his
daughter <i>yanninar</i>.</p>

<p>According to the main thesis of these lectures,
these descriptive usages should own some definite
social cause. The descriptive terminology seems to
be particularly definite in the case of cousins, and
it might be suggested that they are dependent, at
any rate in part and in so far as Egypt is concerned,
on the prevalence of marriage with a cousin.
Marriages with the daughter of a father’s brother
or of a mother’s brother are especially orthodox
and popular in Egypt, and different degrees of
preference for marriage with different classes of
cousin would produce just such a social need as
would have led to the definite distinction of the
different kinds of cousin from one another by
means of descriptive terms.</p>

<p>It is more probable, however, that the use of
descriptive terms in the languages of the Semites
and of the Shilluks and Dinkas has been the outcome
of a definite form of social organisation, viz.,
that in which the social unit is neither the family
in the narrow sense, nor the clan, but that body
of persons of common descent living in one house
or in some other kind of close association which we
call the patriarchal or extended family, the <i>Grossfamilie</i>
of the Germans. It is a feature of the
Semitic and Nilotic systems, not only to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the four chief categories of cousin, but also the four
chief kinds of uncle or aunt, viz., the father’s
brother, the father’s sister, the mother’s brother
and the mother’s sister, all of whom are habitually
classed together in our system, while some of them
are classed with the father or mother in the classificatory
system. The Semitic and Nilotic terminology
is such as would follow from a form of social
organisation in which the more intimate relationships
of the family in the narrow sense are definitely
recognised, but yet certain uncles, aunts, and
cousins are of so much importance as to make it
necessary for social purposes that they shall be
denoted exactly. The brothers of the father and
the unmarried sisters of the father would be of the
same social group as the father, while the brothers
and unmarried sisters of the mother would be of a
different social group, which would account for
their distinctive nomenclature, while within the
social group it would be necessary to distinguish
the father from his brothers. It would be too
cumbrous to call this variety of system after the
extended family, and I suggest that it should be
called the “kindred” system.</p>

<p>Analogy with other parts of the world suggests
that all those of the same generation in the social
group formed by the extended family may once
have been classed together under one term, and
that, as later there arose social motives requiring
the distinction of different relatives so classed
together, descriptive terms came into use to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the necessary distinctions. You must please regard
this only as a suggestion. We need far more
detailed evidence concerning the social status of
different relatives among the peoples who use these
descriptive terms. Such knowledge as we possess
seems to point to the dependence of the Semitic
and Sudanese terminology upon the social institution
of the extended family, just as our own system
depends on the social institution of the family in
the narrow sense and the classificatory system upon
the clan.</p>

<p>If this descriptive mode of nomenclature be thus
the outcome of a social organisation of which the
essential element is the extended family, I need
hardly point out how natural it is that we should
find this kind of nomenclature so widely in Europe.
The presence of this descriptive terminology in
Celtic and Scandinavian languages, in Lithuanian
and Esthonian, would be examples of the persistence
of a form of nomenclature which had its origin
in the kindred of the extended family. On this
view we must believe that, in other languages of
Europe, this mode of nomenclature has gradually
been replaced by one dependent on the social
institution of the family in the narrow sense.</p>

<p>At this point I should like to sum up briefly the
position to which our argument has taken us. I
have first shown the dependence of a number of
special features of the classificatory system of
relationship upon special forms of marriage. Then
I have shown that certain broad varieties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
classificatory system are to be referred to different
forms of social organisation and to the different
degrees in which the regulation of marriage by
means of clan-exogamy has been replaced by a
mechanism dependent upon kinship or genealogical
relationship. From that I was led to refer the
general features of the classificatory system to the
dependence of this system upon the social unit of
the clan as opposed to the family which I believe
to be the basis of our own terminology of relationship.
I then pointed to several features of the
classificatory system which suggest that it arose in
that special variety of the clan-organisation in
which a community consists of two exogamous
moieties, forming the social structure usually
known as the dual organisation. I considered more
fully the dependence of our own mode of denoting
relatives upon the social institution of the family,
and then a study of the descriptive terminology of
relationship has led me to suggest that certain
modes of denoting relationship in Egypt, the Sudan
and many European countries may be examples of
a third main variety of system of relationship which
has arisen out of the patriarchal or extended family.
We should thus have three main varieties of system
of relationship in place of the two which have hitherto
been recognised, having their origins respectively
in the clan, in the family in the narrow sense, and
in the extended or patriarchal family. These three
varieties may be regarded as genera within each of
which are species and varieties depending upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
special social conditions which have arisen within
each kind of social grouping, either as the result of
changes within each form of social organisation or
of transitions from one form to another. We know
of a far larger number of such varieties within the
classificatory system than within those due to the
two forms of the family, and this is probably due
in some measure to the fact that the classificatory
system is still by far the most widely distributed
form over the earth’s surface. Still more important,
however, is the fact that among the peoples
who use the classificatory system there is an
infinitely greater variety of social institution,
and especially of forms of marriage, than exist
among civilised peoples whose main social unit, the
family, is not one which is capable of any extended
range of variation. The result of the complete
survey has been to justify my use of the classificatory
system as the means whereby to demonstrate
the dependence of the terminology of relationship
upon social conditions. It is the great variability
of this mode of denoting relatives which makes it
so valuable an instrument for the study of the laws
which have governed the history of that department
of language by which mankind has denoted
those who stand in social relations to himself.</p>


<p class="tb">You may have been wondering whether I am
going to say anything about the merits of the controversy
which has till now given to systems of
relationship their chief interest among students of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sociology. I have so far left on one side the subjects
which have been the main ground of controversy
ever since the time of Morgan. You will have
gathered that I regard it as a grave misfortune for
the science of sociology that the topics of promiscuity
and group-marriage should have been thrust
by Morgan into the prominent place which they
have ever since occupied in the theoretical study
of relationship. Even now I should have liked to
leave them on one side on the ground that the
evidence is as yet insufficient to make them profitable
subjects for such exact inquiry as I believe to
be the proper business of sociology. Their very
prominence, however, makes it impossible to leave
them wholly unconsidered, but I propose to deal
with them very briefly.</p>

<p>I begin with the question whether the classificatory
system of relationship provides us with any
evidence that mankind once possessed a form of
social organisation, or rather such an absence of
social organisation, as would accompany a condition
of general promiscuity in which, if one can speak
of marriage at all, marriage was practised between
all and any members of the community, including
brothers and sisters. I can deal with this subject
very briefly because I hope to have succeeded elsewhere
in knocking away the support on which the
whole of Morgan’s own construction rested.</p>

<p>Morgan deduced his stage of promiscuity from
the Hawaiian system, which he supposed to be the
most primitive form of classificatory nomenclature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
In an article published in 1907 I showed<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that it
rather represents a late stage in the history of the
more ordinary forms of the classificatory system.
My conclusion at that time was based on the scanty
evidence derived from the relatively few Oceanic
systems which had then been recorded, but my
work since that article was written has shown the
absolute correctness of my earlier opinion, which I
can now support by a far larger body of evidence
than was available in 1907. It remains possible,
however, that the Hawaiian system may have had
its source in promiscuity, even though this condition
be late rather than primitive, but it would
be going beyond the scope of these lectures to deal
fully with this subject here. I cannot forbear,
however, from mentioning that Hawaiian promiscuity,
in so far as it existed, was not the condition
of the whole people, but only of the chiefs who
alone were allowed to contract brother and sister
marriages, while I have evidence that the avoidance
of brother and sister in Melanesia, which has so
often been regarded as a survival of man’s early
promiscuity, is capable of a very different explanation.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Our available knowledge, whether derived
from features of the classificatory system or from
other social facts, does not provide one shred of
evidence in favour of such a condition as was put
forward by Morgan as the earliest stage of human
society, nor is there any evidence that such promis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>cuity
has ever been the ruling principle of a people
at any later stage of the history of mankind.</p>

<p>The subject of group-marriage is one about
which I do not find it possible to speak so dogmatically.
It would take me more than another
lecture to deal adequately with the Melanesian
evidence alone, and I must content myself with two
remarks. Firstly, I think it desirable to throw
aside the term group-marriage as only confusing
the issue, and to speak rather of a state of organised
sexual communism, in which sexual relations are
recognised as orthodox between the men of one
social group and the women of another. Secondly,
the classificatory system has several features which
would follow naturally from such a condition
of sexual communism. I have evidence from
Melanesia which places beyond question the former
presence of such a condition, with features of
culture which become readily explicable if they
be the survivals of such a state of sexual communism
as is suggested by the terminology of the
classificatory system. This evidence comes from
only one part of the world, but it is enough to
convince me that we have no right to dismiss from
our minds a state of organised sexual communism
as a feature of the social development of mankind.
The wide distribution of the classificatory system
would suggest that this communism has been very
general, but it need not have been universal, and
even if the widespread existence of organised
sexual communism be established, it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
follow that it represents the earliest stage in the
evolution of human society. There are certain
features even of the classificatory system itself
which suggest that, if this system be founded in
sexual communism, this communism was not
primitive, but grew out of a condition in which
only such ties of kinship were recognised as would
result from the social institution of the family.</p>

<p>I must be content with this brief reference to
the subject. The object of these lectures is to
demonstrate the dependence of the terminology of
relationship upon social conditions, and the dependence
of the classificatory system upon a condition of
sexual communism is not now capable of demonstration.
The classificatory mode of denoting
relationship should, however, act as a suggestion
and stimulus, and as a preventative of dogmatic
statement in a part of our subject which, in spite
of its entrancing interest, still lies only at the edge
of our slowly spreading circle of exact knowledge.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to point out briefly
some of the lessons of more general interest which
may be learnt from the facts I have brought before
you in these lectures. I hope that one result
has been to convince you of the danger lying in
the use of the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument
when dealing with cultures widely different from
our own. In the literature of the subject one often
meets the adjectives “absurd” and “impossible”
applied in some cases to social conditions in which
the actual existence of the absurdities or impossi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>bilities
can be demonstrated. I may take as an
example the argument of Mr. N. W. Thomas,
which I have already mentioned, in which the
classing of the maternal grandfather with the elder
brother by the Dieri is regarded as reducing to an
absurdity the contention that classificatory terms
express ties of kinship. If Mr. Thomas had had
a more lively faith in the social meaning of terms
of relationship, he might have been led to notice that
the Dieri marry the granddaughter of a brother,
a fact he appears, in common with many other
readers of Howitt, to have missed; one result
of this marriage is to bring about just such a
relationship as Howitt records without a man being
his own great-uncle, as is supposed to be necessary
by Mr. Thomas.</p>

<p>Still another example may be taken from Professor
Kroeber. He states that the classing together
of the grandfather and the father-in-law which is
found in the Dakota system, when worked out to
its implications, would lead to the absurd conclusion
that marriage with the mother was once
customary among the Sioux. Here again, if
Professor Kroeber had been less imbued with his
belief in a purely linguistic and psychological chain
of causation, and had been ready to entertain the
idea that there might be a social meaning, he must
have been led to see that the features of nomenclature
in question would follow from other forms
of marriage, and two of these, whatever their
apparent improbability in America, cannot well be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
called absurd, since they are known to occur in
other parts of the world. Following Riggs, Professor
Kroeber does not specify which kinds of
grandfather and father-in-law are classed together
in Dakotan nomenclature, but in the full list given
by Morgan, it is evident that one term is used for
the fathers of both father and mother and for the
fathers of both husband and wife. The classing of
the father’s father with the wife’s father would be
a natural result of marriage with the father’s sister,
while the common nomenclature for father’s father
and husband’s father would result from marriage
with the brother’s daughter. It is not without
significance that the features of nomenclature
which would be the result of one or other, or of
both these marriages, occur in a system which also
bears evidence of the cross-cousin marriage, for
these three forms of marriage occur in conjunction
in one part of Melanesia, viz., the Torres Islands.</p>

<p>The foregoing instance, together with many
others scattered through these lectures, will have
pointed clearly to another lesson. In the present
state of our knowledge a working scheme or
hypothesis has largely to be judged by its utility.
A way of regarding social phenomena which
obstructs inquiry and leads people to overlook
facts has its disadvantages, to say the least,
while a scheme or hypothesis which leads people
to worry out and discover things which do not lie
on the surface will establish a strong claim on our
consideration, even if it should ultimately turn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to be only the partial truth. I will give only one
instance to illustrate how a belief in the dependence
of the terminology of relationship on forms
of marriage might act as a stimulus to research.</p>

<p>In a system from the United Provinces recorded
by Mr. E. A. H. Blunt in the Report of the last
Indian Census, one term, <i>bahu</i>, is used for the
son’s wife, for the wife, and for the mother.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Mr.
Blunt puts on one side without hesitation the
possibility that such common nomenclature can
have been the result of any form of marriage,
and ascribes it to the custom whereby a man and
his wife live with the husband’s parents, in consequence
of which the son’s wife, who is called
<i>bahu</i> by her husband, is also called <i>bahu</i> by everyone
else in the house. The causation of the common
nomenclature which is thus put forward is a
possible, perhaps even a probable, explanation. In
such a case we should have a social chain of
causation in which the son’s wife is called <i>bahu</i>
because she is one of a social group bound together
by the ties of a common habitation. It can do no
harm, however, to bear in mind as an alternative
the possibility that the terminology may have arisen
out of a form of marriage. It is evident that the
use of a common term for the wife and the son’s
wife would follow from a form of polyandry in
which a man and his son have a wife in common.
A further result of this form of marriage would
be that the wife of the son, being also the wife of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his father, would have the status of a mother.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
We have no evidence for the presence of such a
marriage in India, but our knowledge of the
sociology of the more backward peoples of India is
not so complete that we can afford to neglect any
clue. The possibility suggested by the mode of
using the term <i>bahu</i> should lead us to look for other
evidence of such a form of polyandry among the
ruder elements of the population of India, of whose
social structure our present knowledge is so fragmentary.</p>

<p>Another important result of our study of the
terminology of relationship is that it helps us to
understand the proper place of psychological
explanation in sociology. These lectures have
largely been devoted to the demonstration of
the failure to explain features of the terminology
of relationship on psychological grounds.
If this demonstration has been successful, it
is not because the terminology of relationship
is anything peculiar, differing from other bodies of
sociological facts; it is because in relationship we
have to do with definite and clean-cut facts. The
terminology of relationship is only a specially
favourable example by means of which to show the
value of an attitude towards, and mode of treatment
of, social facts which hold good, though less
conspicuously, throughout the whole field of
sociology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In social, as in all other kinds of human activity,
psychological factors must have an essential part.
I have myself in these lectures pointed to psychological
considerations as elements in the problems
with which the sociologist has to deal. These
psychological elements are, however, only concomitants
of social processes with which it is possible
to deal apart from their psychological aspect.
It has been the task of these lectures to refer the
social facts of relationship to antecedent social conditions,
and I believe that this is the proper method
of sociology. Even at the present time, however,
it is possible to support sociological arguments by
means of considerations provided by psychological
motives, and the assistance thus rendered to sociology
will become far greater as the science of social
psychology advances.</p>

<p>This is, however, a process very different from the
interpolation of psychological facts as links in the
chain of causation connecting social antecedents
with social consequences. It is in no spirit of
hostility to social psychology, but in the hope that
it may help us to understand its proper place in
the study of social institutions that I venture to
put forward the method followed in these lectures
as one proper to the science of sociology.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It may be that there will be those who will accept
my main position, but will urge that these lectures
have been devoted to the criticism of an extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
position, the position taken up by Professor
Kroeber. They may say that they have never
believed in the purely psychological causation of
the terminology of relationship. In reply to such
an attitude I can only express my conviction that
the paper of Professor Kroeber is only the explicit
and clear statement of an attitude which is implicit
in the work of nearly all, if not all, the opponents
of Morgan since McLennan. Whether they have
themselves recognised it or not, I believe that it
has been this underlying attitude towards sociological
problems which has prevented them from
seeing what is good in Morgan’s work, from sifting
out the chaff from the wheat of his argument, and
from recognising how great is the importance to
the science of sociology of the body of facts which
Morgan was the first to collect and study. I feel
that we owe a debt of gratitude to Professor
Kroeber for having brought the matter into the
open and for having presented, as a clear issue, a
fundamental problem of the methods of sociology.</p>

<p>Lastly, I should like to point out how rigorous
and exact has been the process of the determination
of the nomenclature of relationship by social conditions
which has been demonstrated in these
lectures. We have here a case in which the principle
of determinism applies with a rigour and
definiteness equal to that of any of the exact
sciences. According to my scheme, not only has
the general character of systems of relationship
been strictly determined by social conditions, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
every detail of these systems has also been so determined.
Even so small and apparently insignificant
a feature as the classing of the sister-in-law with
the sister has been found to lead back to a definite
social condition arising out of the regulation of
marriage and of sexual relations. If sociology is
to become a science fit to rank with other sciences,
it must, like them, be rigorously deterministic.
Social phenomena do not come into being of
themselves. The proposition that we class two
relatives together in nomenclature because the
relationships are similar is, if it stand alone,
nothing more than a form of words. It is incumbent
on those who believe in the importance of the
psychological similarity of social phenomena to
show in what the supposed similarity consists and
how it has come about&mdash;in other words, how it has
been determined. It has been my chief object in
these lectures to show that, in so far as such
similarities exist in the case of relationship, they
have been determined by social conditions. Only
by attention to this aim throughout the whole field
of social phenomena can we hope to rid sociology
of the reproach, so often heard, that it is not a
science; only thus can we refute those who go still
further and claim that it can never be a science.</p>
